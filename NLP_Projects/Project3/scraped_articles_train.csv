2,Internet platforms can’t be allowed to monetise hate,"Netflix’s new documentary, ‘The Social Dilemma’, should be compulsory viewing for Indians. It helps explain the unprecedented spread of hate speech and communal falsehoods. It features executives and IT nerds from top internet companies — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google, YouTube. They say they started by believing that the internet would be a great democratiser, providing voice and knowledge to millions lacking it. Alas, it is also producing terrible polarisation, lies and strife.

This is not because internet companies have bad people or evil intentions. The problem lies in their profit model. They offer great free services. Their profits come from advertising, often subliminal advertising. This means flashing messages for very brief periods below the normal human perception level, reaching the subconscious. Subliminal advertising has long been used by conventional advertisers too, highlighted in books like Vance Packard’s ‘The Hidden Persuaders’. But the smartphone has taken this psychological manipulation to new heights.

Free internet programmes aim to get the attention of as many viewers as possible for as long as possible. They take advantage of the high addictiveness of the net, especially for youngsters. The companies employ algorithms, complex software programmes, to track and analyse every move of viewers, getting to know more about their likes and tendencies than a psychiatrist. Using this psychological knowledge, the algorithms feed viewers with ads and messages that will hook their attention — not just to buy things but use news, videos and other devices that guide viewers into groups with similar likes and dislikes. The algorithms even feed different versions of the same news to different groups to satisfy their psychological needs, deepening polarisation.

Algorithms are driving people into warring camps

The companies seek to link viewers with other viewers as fast as possible to create networks of millions. Advertisers find that the algorithms can help them target the very people and groups most likely to buy their goods and services, at a very low cost per viewer. So, advertising has shifted hugely to the net, making billions for network owners.

Control over the data of viewers has given the companies unprecedented power to influence viewers and make money. Data, it is said, is the new oil. This has raised troubling questions about privacy and security. Many governments now seek to protect data generated in their borders for security reasons. Others are considering proposals to make the companies for the use of viewer data.

But more sinister is the way the networks harness the dark side of human nature to promote polarised groups with a contempt for rival groups that incites hate and violence. The net creates groups of individuals listening only to one another, brimming with dangerous passion.

Within each group, falsehoods and fake news about other groups spread with lightning speed and attempts to tell the truth are dismissed as conspiracies. The IT nerds say that falsehoods spread six times faster and wider than truths, Falsehoods titillate and get lots of viewers, while the truth is mundane and unexciting. The end result of this polarisation, say the nerds, could be violent clashes and even civil war.

The documentary is concerned mainly with the US, which has recently witnessed unprecedented polarisation, fake news and hate speech. This has been blamed on President Trump but should be blamed as much on the algorithms that drive evermore people into warring camps.

In India, the BJP is blamed for communal polarisation for electoral advantage. But that same polarisation is being driven quite independently by internet companies offering free services poisoned with hate. This fortifies the extreme fringes of both Hinduism and Islam, driving India towards Hindu-Muslim militancy.

Forget the pleas of Facebook or Google that they are mere platforms where people meet. They make their money by using algorithms as psychological tools to promote advertising to communities tailor-made for divisiveness. They did not intend the dark side of their business but will not change their strategy because massive profits flow out of it.

Recently Facebook and Twitter have been pressured by the public and advertisers to remove or label hate posts on their sites. I initially supported this move. But I now realise that this does nothing to stop the algorithms that create divisiveness and hate — and profits.

We need a high-powered technical committee full of nerds to find ways to check this. Government regulation is increasing for national security and privacy. But the prime need is regulation to stop the monetisation of hate by internet companies. This may require a new set of counter-algorithms. Pessimists say the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be put back. Nevertheless, we must try. The nerds who contributed to the problem need to contribute to the solution.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
3,Rework Special Marriage Act for love and liberty’s sake,"Sometime in 2014, responding to all the rhetoric around ‘love jihad’, the actor Saif Ali Khan wrote: “Intermarriage is not jihad, intermarriage is India.”

It’s such a romantic idea, belied by reality. Inter-caste marriage still hovers at 5-6%. Marrying across faiths, or transgressing gotra rules still invites terrible violence in parts of this country.

The Special Marriage Act, a law of marriage “between any two persons”, liberates individuals from crushing collectivity. Anyone can marry anyone they choose. It smears the lines that divide us.

But in practice, the Act requires couples to jump through extra hoops to marry outside tradition and community. The Supreme Court is now hearing a plea that seeks to end the mandatory publicising of the couple’s private details for a month, for all to see and anyone to obstruct.

As the petitioners point out, this doesn’t square with the right to privacy. When I got married, a “notice of intended marriage” with our pictures, names, addresses and phone numbers was pinned to the office wall. A friend who visited the office sent me a picture of the peeling notice nearly a year after the event.

For many couples, though, this piece of paper can have devastating effects. One month is enough for families, community busybodies, faith and caste border forces to harass the couple. Public officials, cut from the same conservative cloth, often go along.

The Special Marriage Act was enacted in 1954, as a newly free nation tried to centre the individual, forge a common citizenship, and give women more substantive rights. Nehru and Ambedkar and others pushed this civil family law for those who wanted to step outside their community’s laws. It was resisted by conservative legislators even within the Congress. These strings were attached to the law in its difficult passage through Parliament.

The anxieties and yearnings around personal freedom are plain to see in the movies of the 1950s. And yet, romantic love was the core cinematic dream, as cultural scholar Aarti Wani details in her book Fantasy of Modernity. A modern India was imagined through the subversions and border-crossings of romance, the audacity of falling in love in a social context where most people did not have that option.

The Special Marriage Act embodies that ambivalence — its many conditions undercut its intention. Apart from the time requirement, the residence clause makes it hard for couples to evade unwelcome attention. The law must be redesigned with its original enabling purpose in mind. There could be higher penalties for who raise invalid objections, and disciplinary action against officials who side with social bullying. As a civil law, there is no reason to keep same-sex couples out of its ambit.

And yet, while hearing this petition, the court observed that without this notice period, parents wouldn’t know the whereabouts of their eloping offspring, and a husband wouldn’t know if his wife was marrying another man. This is a bewildering statement. After all, whatever the logic of the patriarchal family, when adult citizens decide to marry in our constitutional republic, parental opinion is beside the point. There are laws to address fraud and bigamy. If no notice is required for marriage under personal law, why should marrying under a secular law outside the canopy of community arouse this special suspicion?

In times when interfaith love is cast as ‘love jihad’, this stamping and hissing chorus is even more oppressive. A few years ago in Karnataka, Hindutva activists piled on to a local paediatrician whose daughter was marrying her Muslim boyfriend, until the young woman shut it down, saying: “It’s my wish”.

But “my wish”, meri marzi, coming from a woman is an earthshaking idea in our culture. In a society stacked by caste and religion, the control of marriage and mating is essential to keep each community sealed and intact. If women do what they want with their bodies and lives, what happens to purity, property, lineage?

Anyone who claims to care about a uniform civil code in good faith should be invested in a better Special Marriage Act. It’s the least we can do, for love and liberty.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
4,"Five winners of the post-pandemic global economy, and a dark horse","Even as Covid-19 continues to bubble up in hot spots all over the world, many people are asking which economies are poised to rise, and which to fail. The first principle is to understand the global environment at any point in time, which now means understanding which rules will be most critical in the post-pandemic world.

The pandemic is accelerating a broad turn inward that began after the global financial crisis of 2008. Globalisation had already given way to de-globalisation, with cross border flows of goods and money in decline before the pandemic hit. Now, even the leaders of nations that were among the biggest beneficiaries of globalisation, including China and India, have begun to champion “self-reliance”— a goal that in recent decades had been pursued mainly by isolated outliers like North Korea.

Governments are also increasing their control over the economy, commanding shutdowns and effectively nationalising business payrolls in ways that would have been unimaginable six months ago. Public debt and budget deficits are exploding in many countries.

The last redoubt of globalisation is the virtual economy, which has accelerated under the lockdowns. As people retreat home to work, play, shop and study, new habits are forming, and these habits are going to help virtual enterprises to continue growing rapidly — from a much higher base — after the pandemic.

What this means for the post-pandemic world is that of my ‘10 Rules of Successful Nations’, those on geography and trade, state competence, debt and investment will have the greatest impact on national success.

The four key strengths: a strong domestic market (or unusual export prowess); a competent government, measured here by the indicators that matter most right now, cases and deaths per million from Covid-19; government debt and deficits; and digital sophistication, including heavy investment in research and development. Screening the major developed and emerging economies for these strengths yields a fascinating and rather surprising list.

Notable is the absence of the two economic superpowers. The US and China don’t make the cut, undermined by heavy debts and by doubts about how their governments handled the pandemic.

India too doesn’t make the cut of the major winners. It has long disappointed optimists and pessimists alike, and tends to rank middle of the emerging world pack on my ten rules. That hasn’t changed with the pandemic. India came in 13th out of 25 largest emerging countries in my post-pandemic screen, and ranked top ten in just one of the four key categories: India is relatively less vulnerable to the forces of deglobalisation, thanks to its vast domestic consumer market.

India’s score for government competence now ranks 13th in this category, with 55 deaths and more than 3,300 cases per million people. Its scores for government debt and deficits place India in the bottom half of the EM class, at number 19.

Finally, and more unexpectedly, India ranks only 16th in the emerging world for digital sophistication. It spends barely half a percentage point of GDP on research and development, and lands at number 14 in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking put out by IMD, the Swiss business school.

Meanwhile, topping the list of potential post-pandemic winners are…

Germany: Leads no category but is near the top in all four. Its lockdowns lasted barely a month, thanks to a quick response so well coordinated between national and local governments. Germany under Angela Merkel, a trained scientist, makes the jousting between Washington and the states look even more embarrassing by contrast.

Germany was the rare country that went into the pandemic with relatively low levels of debt. It could afford the biggest domestic stimulus package of any major nation, and despite extending offers of stimulus to its fellow EU members, it will still come out with the lowest public debt, by far, of any major power. With Merkel leading the effort to create a European Recovery Fund, which could help bridge the continent’s north-south divide, her legacy may well be some sort of a European Renaissance.

Finland: Nokia may have gone the way of the dodo but its old nest is now home to Microsoft, and Finland keeps producing tech giants like Rovio, maker of ‘Angry Birds.’ A top ten tech power according to IMD. With a competent bureaucracy, little household debt and manageable public debt, Finland has no glaring vulnerability to the challenges of the post-pandemic period.

Switzerland: Perhaps Europe’s most streamlined, least centralised government, it has brought the Covid-19 death rate down to near zero, and created an economic relief agency that surprises small business by delivering support loans in a matter of hours.

Astonishingly competitive for such a small country, Switzerland has a smaller population than the Scandinavian countries, but has created twice as many top-100 European companies as the Scandinavian countries combined. The Swiss also generate among the most patents per person in the world and invest heavily in R&D, which is why Switzerland is a top five global tech power as well. (Its one weakness: household mortgage debt.)

Vietnam: Vietnam is realising its potential as “the next China”, a major export power. With an efficient post-communist government, Vietnam has had stunning success containing the pandemic, with only 34 deaths to date. As the rest of the world turns against immigration and trade, Vietnam continues to open up, signing 15 free trade agreements in the last decade. One of precious few nations that was attracting investment in its export factories at an accelerating pace, it is rapidly moving up the manufacturing ladder, from stitching together sneakers to making smartphones and AirPods. The domestic economy is leapfrogging the landline age straight into the mobile internet age. Outside a few small outliers, Vietnam is on track to finish 2020 as the world’s fastest growing economy.

Taiwan: Along with South Korea, Taiwan is one of the two nations able to grow at a rapid pace for five decades in a row. Both rank among the top EM countries on all four post-pandemic factors. Taiwan gets the spotlight by a narrow margin. Like South Korea, it invests heavily in tech and is already one of the world’s most digitised countries. But Taiwan has a slightly lower government deficit and debt, and has capped its Covid-19 death rate at 0.3 per million — lowest among major emerging and developed economies. The Achilles Heel for both is a relatively small and debt-soaked consumer economy, but Taiwan’s consumer market is slightly larger (as a share of GDP) and less debt-ridden.

Russia: A dark horse, Russia does not in fact score in the top five on any single post-pandemic factor. It makes the list largely because it has turned itself into a financial fortress mostly impervious to global markets. In 2014, the debilitating impact of international sanction for the invasion of Ukraine, coupled with a drop in oil prices, persuaded Vladimir Putin’s government to focus on paying down foreign debts and saving oil profits to seal itself from foreign pressure. Russian finances are now so solid, the ruble — unlike other petro currencies — no longer whipsaws with the price of oil. Serendipitously, this insulation from global markets could prove even more valuable at a time when more than half the countries in the world have gone to the IMF for financial help to survive the pandemic.

Thanks in part to the legacy of Soviet science and applied technology, Russia also has a reasonably advanced digital economy, one of the few to produce domestic internet companies that have the potential to withstand challenges from the American and Chinese giants.

It is telling of the coming era that a case can be made to include countries as different as Russia and Germany on this list. To thrive, economies will need a strong defense against the pressures of deglobalisation, debt, and meddling governments, coupled with an offense capable of exploiting the opportunities in the booming digital economy. Though to very different degrees all these nations, so often on opposite sides of history, share this mix of strengths for the future. They have a good shot at thriving in a difficult post-pandemic world.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
5,Exception becomes the norm as special laws are misused,"Delhi Police’s framing and subsequent reframing of charges, using UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act), against the young women of Pinjra Tod a few months ago is an example of the gross misuse of special laws enacted by the state for circumstances which lie outside the purview of ordinary laws. By definition such laws are meant to be temporary and exceptions but end up being permanent and the norm.

Over the years we have accumulated a plethora of such extraordinary laws, at both the central and state levels. Such is the fascination with these ‘extraordinary’ laws that even the judiciary no longer questions their misuse.

As has been the case so often in this country’s history, it was the Congress which set this ugly ball in motion. In 1971, Indira Gandhi passed MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act). It later proved to be very useful in putting two strange bedfellows, the communists and the Jan Sangh behind bars during the emergency. The end of the emergency saw MISA being repealed by the Janata Party of which the Jan Sangh was a part. Interestingly, the short stint that well placed Indian politicians spent in jail between 1975-77 made them suddenly aware of the fact that hundreds of thousands of ‘undertrials’ had been in prison for periods which were sometimes much more than the maximum sentence their crimes would have attracted. The Supreme Court also woke up to the plight of ‘undertrials’ and a clean-up of the system started.

But it was too good to last, and the politician’s impatience with the judicial system it had itself created led to the Jan Sangh’s successor, the BJP, taking up laws intended primarily to bypass judicial scrutiny. With a willing partner in the Congress and other equally authoritarian state-level political parties, the Indian system has seen a slew of Acts passed over the past forty years, all of them much more repressive than MISA.

It would take too much space to list all these in detail here. Their acronyms are enough — so deeply engrained are these in the psyche of the common person: POTA, TADA, ESMA, COFEPOSA, PSA, NSA, AFSPA, UAPA or their state level counterparts like MCOCA, GUJCOCA and KCOCA. Some have been repealed, only to be substituted by more repressive ones — compromising individual liberty. More than a year on, citizens of the country in J&K continue to be denied elementary rights. Those arrested for the Bhima-Koregaon/Elgaar Parishad case have not even got bail even as the prosecution is in no hurry to file the case a year and a half later. The idea is to intimidate and paralyse those who would question state policy. UAPA, for instance, was supposed to be a ‘preventive’ law intended to pre-empt certain ‘unlawful’ activities. It is not as if the criminal code did not contain preventive detention. But these were bailable and the burden was on the state to prove guilt or suspected intent. Under UAPA all that is overturned.

Under UAPA and NSA (National Security Act), bail can be denied almost indefinitely. In many cases, the state is not even under any obligation to present a credible case to the court nor frame charges in a time bound manner. Thus, both UAPA and NSA become easy tools with which anyone can be arrested and denied bail for indefinite periods. Laws and courts the world over have insisted on procedure — which remains the only protection an individual has from the overwhelming might of the state. But with this litany of laws which are slowly getting entrenched in the system, the relationship between crime and punishment is getting obliterated.

A year ago, a forest rights activist told me that corrupt forest departments threatened by exposure of their corruption had found a simple system of keeping activists away — just file charges against them and the adivasis in various courts all over the state. It would be a matter of time before the complex web of absentee lawyers, delayed proceedings, incessant adjournments exhausted even the most dedicated activist and lead to unfettered control by the very same corrupt forest mafias.

What is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander because the counterparts of the forest officials have found laws by which they can lock up all those who would oppose state policies under obscure laws which serve not the Constitution judges are sworn to protect but those who would rule by exception.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
6,"How to bring back hope: Fair, stable and socially moderate policies are a prerequisite for economic revival","Strong leaders bristle at criticism. Therefore it was a nice surprise when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at an inaugural public function of Rajasthan Patrika Gate recently, observed that criticism in the era of social media is natural and can strengthen democracy. I’m taking him at his word and sharing some thoughts on the ailing economy, and what steps he may need to take to create an ecosystem for reviving it.

Earlier in January this year, Modi met some business leaders in New Delhi – the usual lot who also used to meet the UPA leaders. The exercise was intended to get feedback from the tycoons on the state of the economy, already in the doldrums then, before Covid plunged it to abysmal depths. Our business leaders – who sing paeans even when a lacklustre Budget is presented – spoke of the usual things: credit squeeze, stimulating demand, tax terrorism, simplifying GST, monetary policies, fiscal deficits and so forth.

What wasn’t said in the various PM’s meetings was more important than what was conveyed – the need for Modi to focus on fixing the trust deficit between government and sections of India’s civil society. He should have been told that the present rightwing politics which is continually stirring the communal pot, isn’t enabling the ecosystem of social harmony to prevail.

This isn’t to give a clean chit to rabid groups on the left, but to point out that the Union government must act firmly, swiftly and justly against zealots and fanatics acting illegally on both sides of the social and political divide, and to bridge the chasm between pro-government cheerleaders and anti-government protesters, where current politics invariably overrides rule of law.

India Inc, in its frequent interactions with the PM, should drive home the simple fact that peace and stability are a prerequisite to getting the economy back on track, and that needs to be in place before administering any medicines for the country’s economic ills.

The economy can’t be fixed by enabling the rise of stocks of a few companies that take average indices to a high. We can’t achieve meaningful development worth its name if there’s perennial social strife. India Inc must stop behaving like ostriches, restricting itself to seek policy benefits. During the years of racist conflict in America, Emerson said “trade is a plant which always grows wherever there’s peace, as soon as there’s peace, and as long as there’s peace.”

Businesses in general (and even businesses of crony capitalists) can’t prosper in isolation over the long term if there’s widespread and prolonged inequity and constant friction and conflict in society – conflicts of class, caste and religion, resulting in the collapse of the rest of the economy. When a ship sinks all aboard perish.

Now for some candid admissions and stark truths. Our big business tycoons are a bigger threat to the growth of a liberal economy than politicians, because they want to do away with competition, harking back to our ‘licence raj’ days of Ambassador cars. Once they reach the top they forget it was reforms that catapulted them to those dizzy heights.

Individual business houses lobbying in the shadows to secure special dispensations and garner unfair competitive advantage over others, including multinationals, are at cross purposes with Modi’s grand vision of ‘Make In India’ and in conflict with his ambitious plans of attracting FDI and moving up the ladder of ease of doing business.

Investors come to India captivated by the India growth story, and after being wooed by the PM and state leaders when they meet them during their overseas trips. After they invest, if they discover that policies are changed at will to suit local business tycoons and rules are interpreted by clever bureaucrats who lay booby traps and make it difficult for them to grow, then future foreign investments will dry up. It will also shake the confidence of local industry.

Amazon and Walmart are already crying foul. In effect, foreign companies feel that doing business in India depends on who you know. It’s a snakes and ladders game. When governments renege on their promises and promote some business houses over others, the economy will be adversely affected and entrepreneurial spirit will evaporate. There will also be retaliation on our exports and on businessmen who invest abroad.

It’s not easy to steer the economy of a large complex country where multiple contrasting Indias – islands of prosperity in a vast sea of poverty and ignorance – coexist. When the country is faced with threats on three fronts – a plummeting economy, the Covid virus, and a belligerent China on our borders – the PM must surround himself with the best minds from around the world. And there’s no dearth of them. Hence his eagerness to engage with critics has to be lauded.

By virtue of the mandate he commands, both in the country and within his party, it behoves Modi – as the leader of the largest democracy that aspires to be among the prosperous nations of the world – to reach out and unite a currently polarised nation. He must bring back hope. Hope that things will mend no matter how tough the times are now, hope that the future holds promise. Hope, the invisible fuel of an economy, seems absent now.

Because, no matter how noble or correct the intentions, no shop can do good business in a bad neighbourhood.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
7,"Reform friction: Centre mustn’t buckle, small farmers matter","The Modi government mustn’t waver on the farm reform legislations despite protests in Punjab and Haryana, which prompted Akali Dal’s exit from the ministry. The two bills relating to creating a viable alternative to agricultural market produce committees (APMCs) and facilitating contract farming can help small farmers discover fair prices for farm produce and bring better services to the farmgate. APMCs haven’t lived up to their promise due to cartelisation and the difficulty of small farmers in transporting their produce to APMC marketyards.

The criticism of federal overreach needs to factor in the big picture. States are unable to usher in such reforms as they are often hostage to big farmer and middlemen lobbies. By striking compromises on GST compensation, Centre could have offset the complaints of states of revenue loss for sales outside APMCs. PM Modi has made a weighty promise to farmers, 86% of whom are small and marginal farmers, to double their incomes by 2022. The status quo, including minimum support prices, isn’t helping enough farmers unlike direct benefit transfers, besides distorting markets and cropping patterns too.

Centre has clarified that it isn’t undermining APMCs or MSPs but merely increasing competition by allowing agribusinesses, food processors, wholesalers, exporters and big retailers to source directly from farmers. Opposition parties are joining the protests for political mileage, but government must improve its messaging on the salience of these reforms. Besides politicisation, the other weakness is the variance between policy and practice. Despite amending the Essential Commodities Act to remove stockholding limits and intemperate regulations on most commonly consumed commodities, Centre has again banned onion exports. Such moves run counter to the professed desire to find new export markets and hinder farmers from securing the benefit of even small increases in wholesale prices.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
8,She’s got the look: Naomi Osaka and Lady Gaga go mask to mask,"The masks had a message, when en route to winning the US Open Naomi Osaka, ranked the highest paid female athlete on the planet, wore seven of those with the names of seven black people who have been victims of violence. Seven matches, seven masks, seven names. She felt the point was to make people start talking. And they certainly did that, all over the world.

The masks themselves were the message, when Lady Gaga donned a wacky variety of them at the MTV Video Music Awards, including a galactic pink mask with ventilation and something resembling a fishbowl. Seven appearances, seven masks. She did for masks what designers like Dior and Chanel have been doing for fashion forever. She told audiences world over, wear a mask, it’s a sign of respect.

By now it’s well established that wearing a mask reduces risk of Covid both for you and those around you (so long as the mask fits properly). It rebuilds economies. So what explains the research suggesting that men are less likely to wear face masks than women? Is this because men have a lesser sense of responsibility or a greater sense of invulnerability? More useful than sweeping generalisations would be different social agents pulling together to push behaviourial change. To convince a larger population that, as Sunny Leone annotated a social media selfie with a mask, “Safe is the new COOL.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
9,IPL reboots today. It could provide just the psychological boost we need in these desperate Covid times,"We in India love our numbers. In the last six months, these have mostly been about Covid cases and recoveries and infection rates and tests. Each one of us has suffered from a sense of anxiety and helplessness, and incessant coverage of the rising numbers hasn’t helped. We desperately needed a release.

That’s why the IPL is so important. It’s a pan-Indian festival, so uniquely our own that each one of us associates with it in some form. No one needs to tell us to watch the IPL. We will do so voluntarily. No one will need to tell us to stay indoors, as we consume the spectacle that is starting to unfold in the UAE every evening, for the next two months.

It’s an unwritten stay at home order of sorts that will ease the pressure on the political class as India settles into a routine it was craving for so badly. Some are worried about the lack of fans in the stands. Frankly, it won’t matter. Fans are waiting to consume the action on television and digital, and each ball bowled and run scored will be watched by millions across the country.

It might well be that IPL 2020 is the most watched sports event ever with India finally getting to do something it loves. It’s a kind of getting our lives back moment for many, lives that we had all lost to Covid. The virus, make no mistake, is still around and will be for some time to come. But it also means that not everything is lost to it and humanity is starting to come to terms with Covid, working out ways where things can go on while keeping the virus at bay.

Moreover, we will not have to consume political venom on primetime news television, and for once the numbers will be about runs scored and wickets taken and asking rates and sixes hit. A new normal that is welcome rather than scary.

Cricket and more generally sport will emerge richer and stronger out of the IPL. For a while there was a sense of complacency in live sport production and fans, integral to the health of the industry, were taken for granted. Covid has changed it all and in doing so has offered the stakeholders a huge opportunity in revolutionising sport going forward. Covid is disruptive and as a result provocative. It has pushed us out of our comfort zones and forced us to rethink existing ways of producing and consuming sport.

To make up for empty stands, every household or couch can now be converted into a mini stadium. While watching the broadcast, fans can be empowered to send in their feedback real time using technology and such images, provided by the fans themselves can be broadcast within seconds – making cricket more all encompassing than before. And in a post-Covid world when things return to near normal with a vaccine, sport would have gained a toehold in newer markets, making it a bigger industry than it ever was.

Finally, if the IPL doesn’t happen the sport economy in India is certain to contract by at least 30%. To illustrate the point better, in pre-Covid times newspapers had three pages dedicated to sport. There were regular shows on national television and the digital realm was full of sports stories. Since the pandemic started many newspapers had all but done away with the sports page. While some like TOI kept it going, the space allocated to sport was drastically reduced.

It was natural because there was no live sport. Each one of us who are part of the fraternity felt pangs of anxiety. That’s where IPL assumes centerstage. IPL was never about Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni. As Sunil Gavaskar rightly said, “It’s also about the bigger picture. The broadcaster, media, groundsmen, technical staff and everyone associated who draw their sustenance from it.” That’s why we need it.

The start of the tournament means sport in India is relevant. And to note that in an ambience of economic gloom BCCI has managed to rake in Rs 350 crore from sponsorship speaks volumes of the robustness of the IPL brand and its relevance for the Indian market. There’s a silver lining at the end of this tunnel. There always is.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
10,Big brother’s watching: Are Chinese companies part of Beijing’s sprawling surveillance state run by the Communist Party?,"Do Chinese companies work for the Communist Party-led government in Beijing? Their suspected role as potential state directed actors has emerged as a key bone of contention in US-Chinese trade negotiation. Although China vehemently denies US assertions that technology giant Huawei is effectively a part of the PRC surveillance state, recent directives issued by CCP Chairman Xi Jinping reinforce the notion that companies may be pressured to act at the party’s direction in a crisis.

Addressing private sector employees at a conference this week, Xi called on companies to create “a backbone team of private business people that is dependable and usable in key moments”. Xi did not explain why businesses need to be “dependable” or how they might be “used” or what he means by “key moments”, but his calls for companies to be patriotic and “share the worries for the country” suggest a sense of urgency. Veteran China watcher Bill Bishop has called the mysterious reference “ominous”.

Of course, the suggestion about the potential intelligence collection role of Chinese companies isn’t new. In 2014 and then again in 2017, the Communist Party declared that all Chinese companies must assist the government in gathering intelligence. This exhortation is codified in law in Article 7 of China’s National Intelligence Law, which stipulates that “Any organisation or citizen shall support, assist with, and collaborate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law, and keep the secrets of the national intelligence work known to the public.”

Such unambiguous instructions make China’s denials of Huawei’s involvement in surveillance activity all the more implausible. TikTok, the Chinese app that was banned in India along with dozens of others, denies that it helped the Chinese government. India said that theft and unauthorised, surreptitious transmission of users’ data from these apps “impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India”. A TikTok statement that “We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,” managed to elide the small matter of its Article 7 obligations.

In a forthcoming book, former Trump national security adviser HR McMaster states that the Chinese government encourages state owned and private enterprises to acquire foreign companies with advanced technologies, or take strong minority stake in those companies, “so that the technologies can be applied for not only economic but also military and intelligence advantage”. Chinese attempts to obtain advanced technologies and industrial secrets through underhand or illegal means have reached levels that force the FBI to work overtime. “We’ve now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours,” the FBI director revealed in July. “Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China.” Not surprisingly, federal agents have arrested several Chinese and American nationals for engaging in industrial espionage for their Chinese clients.

PRC economic espionage activities have been supplemented by the ramped up operations of the Communist Party’s United Front Work Department, a body that encompasses a network of Communist Party-backed agencies and organisations striving to expand an informal coalition of groups and individuals working towards the party’s goal of realising the “China dream”. Since taking power, Xi has re-energised the department holding the first national conference in nine years. He has vastly expanded its operation – from provincial levels in China to obscure places in foreign countries. He promised to support overseas Chinese to help the motherland by “various means”. A recent Jamestown Foundation’s report synthesising Chinese budget reports concluded that various United Front organisations spent more than $2.6 billion in 2019, including nearly $600 million to influence foreigners and overseas Chinese communities.

India’s move to ban Chinese apps and block investment by Chinese firms that could affect national security may prove to be a small but important step in countering the Communist Party’s vast worldwide network for surveillance and theft of intellectual property.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com

15,When You Lose Control In An E-coup,"When we disregard all boundaries in our personal, professional and public lives, there could be chaos. With lines blurring between work, family, friends, society and self, we no longer know the difference between work time, family time, social media time and me time.



During the Covid-19 pandemic, with social (physical) distancing the expected norm, no real time can be spent with friends, relatives and colleagues outside the home. Fortunately for the isolated, technology is a great enabler not just for communication and work, but for entertainment, too. The scary part is we have allowed e-devices and digital platforms to overtake our needs.



Call it lockdown fatigue, stress, overwork, lack of privacy for some, loneliness for others – and the burnout, breakdown or metaphorical paralysis happens, so silent, so stealthy. What happened, everyone asks; everything was fine, wasn't it? Yes, until the e-coup happened.



A medical professional posted a tweet recently, quoting from ‘The One Thing’, a book that upholds the importance of focusing on just one thing at a time. The authors Gary Keller and Jay Papasan, hold no brief for multitasking.



‘Hey, how many things can you do at a time,’ was a talking point that would inspire members of a gathering to garner praise for the many tasks they could accomplish simultaneously. The tweet shared this quote: “The rise in technology, while powerfully connecting us, also obliterates the very boundaries necessary for our emotional well-being…” The doctor confesses, “Which is why I actively maintain personal distance from my social media accounts, even while using them to grow.”Amishi Jha, cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist at the University of Miami, uses neurobehavioural measures to study how the brain pays attention, the mental effects of stress and ways to optimize attention. She says multitasking is a “complete myth”. In an interview with The Times of India in 2018, Jha said that our mind cannot pay attention to more than one thing at one time.Jha who has researched the phenomenon of multitasking, said that if you think you are on your phone listening to a conversation and replying to emails at the same time; or you are driving and texting, you will get compromised. “While multitasking, we are only doing task switching. It wears us out more than anything else. The fatigue makes you less able to handle your emotional state. It degrades the capacity you need to handle your stress.”This is so evident when it comes to giving only a part of your attention (sometimes grudgingly) while interacting with parents, children, sibling, companion, partner or friend, or while you are driving or preparing meals. Writing and sending off that email even as you answer your child’s questions; texting at the dinner table, scrolling social media posts while “attending” a webinar… there are examples ad infinitum of compulsive multitaskers who pay below optimum attention to what they are doing.Like so many things we believe in, multi-tasking as a modern virtue is one more myth busted – and it comes as a big blow to those of us who took great pride in our acrobat-style task completions. Despite the fact that every one of the tasks or actions -- that were addressed along with many other tasks or actions -- was below par.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
16,You Create Bad Karma When You Are Angry,"According to legend, one man was so upset with the Buddha that he spat on him when he saw him. The Buddha said to Ananda that the man wanted to say something, but he was so angry that he lost control over his speech and carried out the karma of spitting on him. That same man met the Buddha the next day; he regretted his action and fell at the Buddha’s feet. The Buddha turned to Ananda and said that once again, the man had no control over his speech; he could not use language effectively, because he could not choose his words properly.



When a person is angry, his intellect is not able to select words that can constructively convey his feelings. He speaks from a place of anger. Consequently, his ‘language becomes weak’ and whatever he says carries bitterness. In such scenarios, people tend to quarrel, abuse, and try to hurt the other person. Their scattered mind spurs them to act and create broken karmic imprints, so it’s best to be patient with them. When someone is angry with you, don’t try to correct them. Also, don’t latch on to what they say, the real cause of their anger lies deep inside them.



When you feel angry, look for ways to calm yourself, for actions resulting from anger are like smoke arising from fire.



To extinguish fire, you have to throw water on it, and not on the smoke that arises from it. Often, when someone is angry, those around him work towards containing the impact of his harsh words. Hence, the problem stays unresolved. To resolve the problem, focus on its root cause. So it’s a good idea to not only calm an angry person but also to address the cause of his anger.As spiritual practitioners, our sadhana is to work towards not getting angry as anger destroys peace, focus, patience and jnana. The Bhagwad Gita says that anger creates ignorance, which in turn, leads to smriti bhram, confusion, and eventual loss of jnana. When a person loses jnana, his fall is imminent; he stoops to a lower level of existence. ■",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
17,SACRED SYMBOLS,"

SADHVI KAMAL VAISHNAV writes of the significance of the conch, chakra, padma and mace depicted in the murtis of Vishnu, the preserver



Sanatana Dharma means eternal, that which has neither beginning nor an end. Deity invocation is an integral part of Sanatana Dharma. Followers of Sanatana Dharma form a personal connection with God through the deity worship. The deities, in the form of paintings, sculptures and other media, are symbols of a devotee’s faith in divinity. By giving forms to the formless Divine Consciousness, we tend to create an emotional bond with the divine force that invariably emits positive energy.



There are 33 categories of deities who are believed to keep the wheels of the world rolling, a wide variety of powerful beings who come to the aid of humankind, as and when they are invoked.



Brahma creates the universe and Vishnu preserves and manages it. Murtis of Vishnu depict him with four arms, holding a conch, Sudarshan Chakra, padma and mace, one in each hand.



Conch: The conch signifies naad, the cosmic sound. The sound that emanates from the conch is considered to be similar to that of Aum. It is believed to transmit positive energy and destroy negative energy.



It is also suggested that our bodies too have such a sound, the self-sound, that can also be called the voice of the soul. This sound resonates within before we commit an action — good or bad karma. If we listen to this sound within and then carry out all activities, our lives will become truthful, meaningful, easy and simple. The conch shell symbolises the deep connection of prana shakti, life force, with the innate sound of the soul. It reminds us to remain connected with the soul and introspect and then act in the outer world. Experts have proved that blowing the conch has scientifically-backed therapeutic benefits. For example, the lungs of a conch-blower remain strong and efficient. Such a person enjoys enduring memory and hearing power.The Sudarshan Chakra is the unique weapon of Vishnu. It is a symbol of foresight and determination. A determined person walking on the righteous path is always victorious in achieving his goals.The chakra also symbolises the never-ending cycle of karma that is ceaseless. It teaches all beings to be aware of this cycle of karma. They must strive to be determined and to be watchful of all their actions.The lotus flower is a symbol of truth, concentration, and detachment.Just as the lotus keeps itself clean and floats above the mud, all living beings too should stay afloat despite the swamps of maya, often referred to as materialism, which, in fact, is a world of illusions. Like the lotus flower, we too should keep ourselves detached from materialism and be honest with others. This means that we should not be engrossed in the illusory world and not let the hunger for ill-gotten maya reside in us.In simpler terms, the lotus flower teaches us to dissociate ourselves from attachment to the impermanent world and connect with the Divine Consciousness within — our Atman, Soul. Just like mud is required to fulfil the physical sustenance of the lotus, similarly worldly substances or materials are needed only to support the physical existence of human beings. These should not overwhelm our connection with the divine force.: It is a symbol of the eternal power of God. According to our good or bad deeds, evil doers are penalised, thereby establishing the divine system of justice.The symbols of conch, chakra, padma and mace inherently expound the significance of karma in connecting the human soul with the divine force that is all-pervasive and omnipotent. ■",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com
18,Fill Your Emptiness,"

People are doing that all the time — just imitating others. And they are always in trouble, because they cannot do this and they cannot do that. They feel inferior. The whole world suffers from an inferiority complex in some way or other, for the simple reason that we go on comparing.



In fact, everyone is so unique that all comparison is utterly wrong. You don’t know your uniqueness. You have never encountered yourself. You have never looked in that direction at all. You are bound to feel inferior. Even the people you call very great, all feel inferior in some way or other, maybe in different ways. He may not be as beautiful as someone else, as healthy as someone else, such a great musician as someone else.



Life consists of millions of things, and if you are constantly comparing… that’s what you have been told to do. You have been brought up and educated in such a way that you are constantly comparing. Someone or other is taller than you, more beautiful, more intelligent, more virtuous, religious, meditative. And you are always in a state of inferiority, suffering.



You Are Unique

Look within and you will experience great uniqueness.



All inferiority disappears, evaporates; it was created by you and by wrong education, by a subtle strategy of comparison. Once you know your uniqueness you are joyous, and then there is no need to follow anyone. Learn from everyone.You can learn from everyone, not only from man but from animals, from trees, clouds, rivers. But there is no question of imitating. You can’t become a river, but you can learn some river-like quality: the flow, the let-go. You can learn something from a rose flower... so delicate yet so strong in the wind, rain, and sun. By evening it will be gone, but it has no care about it; it is joyous in the moment. You can learn from the rose how to live in the moment. Right now the rose is dancing in the wind, in the rain, unafraid, unconcerned for the future. By evening the petals will wither away, but who bothers about the evening? This moment is all, and this dance is all there is.Learn something from the bird on the wing. Learn the courage — to go into the unbounded. Learn from all sources, but don’t imitate. And that is possible only if you have found the right space to begin with — and that is acquaintance with yourself…. You feel empty and go on making all kinds of effort to fill that emptiness. It cannot be filled. Experience it and you will be surprised; emptiness looks empty only from the outside. When you go inside it, it is a fullness of its own kind. It is vast, infinite. It has tremendous beauty of silence, purity. And you will not look at it as emptiness in a negative sense; you will start feeling a positive well-being in it. It is spaciousness and roominess, not emptiness.That’s the message of Zen: to experience your emptiness so totally that the emptiness itself becomes fullness.

19,Learning About Belief Is The End Of Belief,"



Questioner: Is there a god? If there isn't, life has no meaning. Not knowing god, man has invented him in a thousand beliefs and images. All emphasized belief. ""Believe and then you will know; without belief you can never know."" What do you think?

Krishnamurti: Is belief necessary to find out? To learn is far more important than to know. Learning about belief is the end of belief. When the mind is free of belief then it can look. It is belief, or disbelief, that binds; for disbelief and belief are the same: the opposite sides of the same coin. So we can completely put aside positive or negative belief; the believer and the non-believer are the same. When this actually takes place then the question, ""Is there a god?"" has quite a different meaning. The word god with all its tradition, its memory, its intellectual and sentimental connotations - all this is not god. The word is not the real. So can the mind be free of the word?



Questioner: I don't know what that means.

Krishnamurti: The word is the tradition, the hope, the desire to find the absolute, the striving after the ultimate; it’s the movement which gives vitality to existence.



So the word itself becomes the ultimate, yet we can see that the word is not the thing. The mind is the word, and the word is thought.



Questioner: And you're asking me to strip myself of the word? How can i do that? The word is the past; it is memory. The wife is the word, and the house is the word. In the beginning was the word. Also the word is the means of communication, identification. Your name is not you, and yet without your name I can't ask about you. And you're asking me if the mind can be free of the word -- that is, can the mind be free of its own activity?

Krishnamurti: In the case of the tree, the object is before our eyes, and the word refers to the tree by universal agreement. Now with the word ‘god’ there is nothing to which it refers, so each man can create his own image of that for which there is no reference. The theologian does it in one way, the intellectual in another, and the believer and the non-believer in their own different ways. Hope generates this belief, and then seeking. This hope is the outcome of despair - the despair of all we see around us in the world. From despair hope is born, they also are two sides of the same coin. When there is no hope there is hell, and this fear of hell gives us the vitality of hope. Then illusion begins. So the word has led us to illusion and not to god at all. God is the illusion which we worship; and the non-believer creates the illusion of another god which he worships -- the State, or some utopia, or some book which he thinks contains all truth. So we are asking you whether you can be free of the word with its illusion.



Questioner: I must meditate on this.

Krishnamurti: If there is no illusion, what is left?



Questioner: Only what is.

Krishnamurti: The ""what is"" is the most holy.

20,Shoulder Pain: Why it Hurts & When to Worry (Bursitis & Beyond),"The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body. Because of its extensive range of motion, it’s susceptible to injury and pain. The shoulder can hurt after it has been injured or for no apparent reason. And though most shoulder problems are relatively short-lived, the pain is sometimes indicative of a more complex issue. Here’s a guide to what might be wrong and whether or not it’s a cause for concern.

No Worries:

Slight pain with elevation and when playing overhead sports is common. The four tendons that make up the rotator cuff and the biceps tendon (the combined musculature that drives the shoulder motions) can be inflamed by activities such as throwing, shooting basketballs, and lifting weights overhead. The tendons are covered by a thin layer called a bursa, which swells when irritated. The resulting bursitis is filled with inflammatory components that irritate the nerve fibers, sending pain signals to the brain. Eliminating overhead activities and the occasional use of anti-inflammatories usually cures mild bursitis or tendonitis and solves the problem.

Exercises to strengthen posture are also commonly used by our physical therapists to fix mild shoulder irritations. Slumping at your desk, reaching for your mouse, hunching over your keyboard, can all put extra strain on the shoulder, neck, or back, and may be the cause of your shoulder pain.

What To Do:

Specific shoulder exercises start with posture correction. Stand with your shoulders at or behind your hips with your belly button tucked in and notice the difference. By squeezing your shoulder blades together repetitively during the day, with your stomach in and head up, you can correct your posture and relieve mild impingement pain. Perform all exercises for the shoulder with your hands below the level of the shoulder, then use free weights and resistance cords for internal and external strengthening exercises, including biceps curls and triceps pushes.

More Worry:

Pain that does not go away or pain that occurs with every activity indicates that the key tissues are irritated enough that they are sending pain signals even without motion. This degree of inflammation precedes more structural injuries—such as tears of the tissue or early arthritis. Treated early, full rotator cuff tears and eventual arthritis can be prevented. The treatments are often injections of growth factors from platelets, amniotic fluid, and lubrication with hyaluronic acid. Physical therapy focuses on shoulder mechanics, muscle strengthening, and sport-specific training to help fix the activity that might be causing the injury. Often we see throwers with slight errors in their throwing mechanics or golfers with swing abnormalities that bring on the problems. Correction of the throw or swing fixes the pain.

We avoid injections of cortisone, as there is clear evidence that it weakens the tissues of the shoulder if used too frequently. Pain can also be generated by shoulder instability, where the shoulder is moving abnormally across the face of the glenoid. While this can be genetic in origin, it is most commonly due to an injury to the labrum or gasket of the joint.

What To Do:

Persistent pain requires a full examination, X-rays, and an MRI. While an ultrasound exam can also add information, nothing gives a more complete picture than an exam with X-ray and MRI imaging. Once a definitive diagnosis is made, targeted therapy can begin. It is sad for us to see small injuries extend into more massive ones due to the lack of an accurate diagnosis. For inflammations and even small tears, injections of biologic therapies, combined with shoulder specific exercises, may be curative. For tears of the labrum and the rotator cuff, a careful decision must be made to select which should be repaired and how the repair is performed.

Real Worry:

Pain at night or pain not improving with therapy after four weeks are red flags. Pain radiating down the arm or up to the neck or to the back is also worrisome, and may indicate injuries not just of the shoulder but sometimes of the neck. It can originate in the discs in the neck or in the nerves at the front of the shoulder called the brachial plexus. These injuries need to be worked up with careful physical exams, X-rays, and MRIs. Instability of the shoulder, with the shoulder popping in or out of the joint, is another area best treated with early repair of the torn ligaments.

A full tear of the rotator cuff will often present with night pain since when you roll over, you push the arm up into the socket through the rotator cuff tear. Torn rotator cuffs fall into two major groups: acute tears and degenerative ones. Acute tears in healthy tissue, when small, may be cured with injections and time. Larger ones, however, are almost always surgically repaired. Degenerative tears that have been present for a long time—and are often associated with some degree of arthritis—fall into a more nuanced decision tree. Some should clearly be repaired. In others, though, the failure rate of repair is high enough that non-operative treatment is the best course. After repair, the patient needs to be ready for a painful three-month rehabilitation course, with full recovery obtained after a year of exercises.

What To Do:

Diagnose and treat early. Fortunately, most of the torn tissue problems in the shoulder can be repaired under a local block with an arthroscope as an outpatient procedure. Only the most severe arthritis cases require bionic (artificial) replacement. Biologic treatments using anabolic stimulation of the tissues with injections, exercise, physical therapy, and activity coaching are becoming more effective, more targeted, and more widespread. The key is to treat them early before full tearing of tissues leads to disability.

21,Obsessions need not morph into compulsions,"Eastern Ladhak stand-off, India-China

Such has been the destiny of India in a span of 70 years, despite the foundation of a detailed, well studied, amalgamated Constitution, much of our energies were utilized in countering “obsessionists”, even “compulsives” on our western and northern borders.

Pakistan is a slightly different story, with the seeds of politically motivated hatred sown at the time of Partition, and later watered by big political players, leading to full- fledged wars in ’65, ’71, Kargil, and daily terrorist intrusions. I would call it a nations obsession, with compulsive actions, that lead to no good, and may inflict economic and diplomatic strictures even on a worldwide scale.

We understand the short- term immaturity, to raise a threatening spectre of their non-violent secular neighbour as a permanent monster to hold on to temporary power. Whenever required, India has responded fittingly. What else can one do? Keeping direct aggression as the last option.

Besides, in a forced pseudo democratic set-up, regionally diverse, politically controlled by the army since inception, nuclear armed without the requisite pre-conditions of absolute and no-use clauses, this becomes a threat to the parent country (with so many militant outfits), and the rest of the world. Kim Jong of South Korea, the only other who so blatantly proclaimed nuclear prowess, finally has realized the wisdom, quoting from the media. Big Boy Trump, as he hilariously said, finally pressed the “bigger” button!

Some of these deviations from peace need to be tackled in the forthcoming UN session.

Any mention of nuclear threat or propaganda by any nation, should be construed as culpable to the act, with the passage of whatever be a reasonable stricture. The UN needs to add muscle to its stature.

Regarding the obsessions of China, their drive for production trading, profiteering is well understood, but the sequence of ’62, Doklam, Nathu La, now Ladakh defy any tangible regional, tactical, trade or global positioning. Consider a lot has changed, and the cat seems to be scraping out of the bag!

The answer of an altered Chinese behaviour is in a long tortuous past. China is heir to the expansionist Qing Empire, and a revisionist power. The traits of expansionism were inherited. Aksai Chin was its perennial obsession. The British made the MC Mahon Line, and Nehru, said that is that.

However, the ‘62 war came about because, while the US was busy with Cuban Communism, China made out posts on Mc Mahon line—PM Nehru, attaching less gravity to it, than what Patel repeatedly pointed out, in what he enacted as “forward move” However, this is an internal matter. India did not do well enough.

To an extent, Tibet has been a side pivot for aggression on both sides. Tibetan philosophy has been close to its origins in India, its concept of “Nirvana”, and austerity. When China occupied Tibet, there was an understanding with India, that it would be made autonomous soon. That tuned out to be a lie.

Re-iterating the expansionist wrath of China, the Doklam episode was an act to punish India for not attending the BRI Summit earlier in 2019. Such tactics are noted globally, spreading a sense of aversion in trading counties. The wise Mr. Xi heads all departments in his country, so there is always fear of inner dissent. There is more spending in internal security than is spent for warfare.

Its beyond diplomatic understanding that a leader of Mr Xi’s stature and experience who has had eighteen meetings with PM Modi is still dilly dallying. The Indian PM has been to China five times. Yet obsessions are taking the shape of “compulsions”.

God forbid, even if that be so, the Indian combat soldier, artillery, is new even renovated for back -up. Plans are drawn, in case of the abhorrible event for mankind, entirely on one man’s whims, who in a Godless country is the GOD take shape.

Tactically, in Ladhak we enjoy a higher ground altitude. Our air power is decidedly superior, and the Indian soldier is more seasoned, and war baked.

What our neighbour should understand, is that India just commissioned the world’s highest airfield at Daulat Bed Oldi.

There is also a 255 kms road that gives India a far better access to LAC.

Just to state briefly, the position is still better at sea. If this be the indecent behaviour of our neighbour, Indian presence is a boat’s row to the Strait of Malacca, from where China draws its energy resources.

But what changes the direction of trade winds, is the recent resurgence of Israel with UAE, Bahrain, Syria, Jordan and Egypt recognizing it. That is a lot of territory and people for business. Would that effect China? There can be more trade and innovations without Belts.

Indian trade deficit with China stands at $ 56 bn. With different sourcing, indigenous manufacture, exports, this amount is 16% of China’s revenues! Who is the loser? India was ready to trade on a status quo basis.

Mr Xi is a world class leader in global trade and manufacture. Muscle flexing comes as an attached instinct after affluence, often fanned by a revival of uncontrollable desires to settle old scores. It seems it is Nature’s trick of making the mind infirm, when it imparts so much of power. Adolf Hitler, Napoleon marching into Russia, Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait, Stalin’s division of Berlin. Thankfully we now have 9 Dan Mr Putin, negotiable, friendly popular! Incidentally both Mr Modi’s Yoga, and Kung-fu are arts developed for and by a focused mind!

Expecting some hand-mind cleansing and social distancing, this UN Session!

22,Need to check fake news business,"Undoubtedly, social media has given a run for the money to the traditional media and destroyed the reputation of many journalists who could in their hey days get away easily manipulating or hiding the truth to help one or the other political party. The social media has also given an avenue to billions to express themselves, exchange views and learn from each others experiences. It has surely dented the ability of some mischievous journalists who thought that they could manipulate the perception of the people.

Notwithstanding the above, social media has also led to a problem of fake news and misinformation which in my opinion is now fast reaching dangerous proportions and if it is not checked now, it can someday create mayhem in the society.

People unabashedly are circulating Fake data to tarnish the image of Government, circulating photo shopped pictures of political rivals, great personalities to vilify their characters, spreading fake messages to whip up communal sentiments- instigate riots and violence, , create panic amongst masses like the one we witnessed during lockdown at Bandra railway station and Anand Vihar Bus station. There are numerous examples one can give ;

One. Muzzafarnagar riots of 2013: fake video fuelled communal passions.

Two. Pic showing Gandhiji pleading Nathuram Not to shoot.

Three. Pic showing Nehruji dancing with a damsel.

Four. A pic showing an old couple tied to a tree by the owners of Private company who are grabbing the land of this poor couple ; to prove How Mr Modi’s policies are helping the corporate.

Five. A picture of a bleeding army officer injured at Jantarmantar, during OROP agitation due to Police action.

New York Times defined Fake News as “a made-up story with an intention to deceive readers”. These are stories or hoaxes with an aim to deliberately misinform, influence people’s views, push a political agenda , cause confusion or tarnish the image of leading businessmen/ entrepreneurs, personalities and leaders. These can often be a profitable business for online publishers. The Fake news stories can deceive people by looking like trusted websites or using similar names and web addresses to reputable news organizations.

Besides the above, they can also be used by the enemies/ nations inimical to our interests to carry out Psychological warfare. Psychological warfare is the planned use of propaganda to mislead, intimidate, demoralize, or otherwise influence the thinking or behavior of an enemy. In a democratic society like ours where we have a wide network of various lobbies, it provides enemy a great opportunity to misuse, spread misinformation , manipulate news and create confusion in the society or tarnish the image of the leader and its armed forces.

Traditionally we received news from trusted sources; be it print or electronic through journalists and media outlets and barring a few exceptions, they normally follow some codes of practice. However, the internet has enabled a whole new method to publish and share information/ news with very little regulation or editorial standards.

Fake news is no longer a rare or isolated phenomenon, but it now appears to be organized and shrewdly disseminated to a target population. It is believed that the high possibility of these organized bodies coming into existence with the help of political influence. Every political party now has media cell where they have hundreds of IT experts doing this job of spreading misinformation and mistrust just for the sake of electoral prospects.

They abuse, trawl and threaten those who oppose their misinformation campaign and in the bargain they are destroying the social fabric of the society, destroying the institutions, damaging the reputation of honest and hardworking people, vilifying the character of leading personalities of the country.

Through this article I beg the PM and all concerned Officials to frame a suitable legislation so as to put an end to this Fake News business before as a Nation and society we may incur a heavy loss.

Yes, the legislation must be so carefully drafted that it does not impinge or take away the Freedom of expression and our ability to exchange views as being gifted by internet.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com

Only three non-NDA parties backed farm bills in Rajya Sabha debate NDA still does not have a majority in the 244 member Rajya Sabha and has to bank on parties like BJD, TRS, AIADMK and even BSP, along with smaller parties, to muster the support for crucial Bills. These parties expressed their opposition to the Bill which was passed without division despite the Opposition demanding it.

Opposition members' conduct in Rajya Sabha 'shameful': Rajnath Singh Lauding Harivansh as a man of values, he said the ""misconduct"" of opposition members towards him was unprecedented.

Tamil Nadu's COVID-19 deaths pass 8,800 mark after 60 people succumbed to the infection This takes the total tally of cases to 5,41,993, the State media bulletin confirmed. The positivity count has consistently been below the 6,000-mark for some time now, providing some relief to authorities after the easing of a state-wide lockdown on August 31.

Will take BJP, allies to court over farm legislations: Amarinder Singh The CM vowed to fight till his last breath to protect the interests of the state's farmers, according to a statement.

Rajya Sabha ruckus ‘saddening, unfortunate, shameful’: Rajnath Singh Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday termed the behaviour of the opposition MPs in Rajya Sabha “saddening, unfortunate and shameful”. Briefing the press on farm bills and Rajya Sabha ruckus, Singh said he is hurt by the way the members of opposition parties flouted the Parliament decorum by tearing off the rule book and breaking microphones. Observing that attempts are being made to mislead the farmers on the farm bills on the basis of rumours, Singh said, “This is not the way a health democracy works.”

Congress to launch agitations against Modi government's new farm laws After Parliament passed the Bills, Rahul Gandhi tweeted from abroad: “Black laws passed by the Modi government will destroy the farm markets under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act. How will the farmers get their MSP? Why don’t the bills guarantee MSP? The government is trying to enslave farmers to corporates and the country will not let this happen.”

Opposition parties move no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh We have no confidence in the Hon’ble deputy chairman and hereby move this motion for his removal.

42,Top Mutual Fund Schemes to Invest in FY 2020-21 on Economic Times,"Equity mutual funds are the best investment option to achieve your long-term financial goals. Countless studies have proven that stocks have the potential to offer superior returns than other asset classes over a long period. So, if you have a long-term financial goal that is at least five to seven years away, you should consider investing in equity mutual fund schemes.However, it is equally important to choose the right equity mutual fund scheme. Your choice of mutual fund scheme should match your goals, investment horizon and risk profile. For example, if you are a conservative equity investor investing for a five-year goal, you may consider investing in largecap mutual fund schemes.If the investor wants to create the corpus without much volatility, he may also consider investing in aggressive hybrid schemes. Aggressive hybrid schemes invest in a mixed portfolio of equity (65-80 per cent) and debt (20-35 per cent). The debt part of the scheme offers stability to the portfolio during volatile times.Investors with moderate risk profile can consider investing in multicap schemes that invest across market capitalisations. These schemes are riskier than largecap schemes but have the potential to offer superior returns.Aggressive investors with a high risk tolerance and longer investment horizon can consider investing in midcap and smallcap schemes . These schemes invest in mid-sized and small-sized companies and can turn highly volatile during a bad phase in the market. However, these companies can grow into large companies and reward investors with extra returns for the extra risk they are taking.Sector schemes or thematic schemes are meant for sophisticated or high networth investors. These schemes can help investors to take exposure to a sector or theme that they want to bet. However, mutual fund advisors believe that investors should invest in these schemes only if they can time their entry and exit in these schemes and have intimate knowledge about the sector.High net worth investors can also look at international schemes to diversify their portfolio across geographies. However, mutual fund advisors believe that small investors should give these schemes a miss as it would dilute total returns from their portfolio.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com
43,"New Japanese PM, warm India-Japan ties","India will miss Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But his successor Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide is likely to continue with Abe’s policies, particularly in the international arena.

There has been a boost to the India-Japanese relationship under Prime Ministers Abe and Modi, and the changing of the guard at Tokyo is unlikely to reverse that course.

The Modi-Abe relationship is an important and sometimes very public feature of the bilateral relationship. However, there is a long and rich history to the relationship between the two countries.

Despite this, it is only with the ‘Look East’ policies of Prime Ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that the bilateral relationship was given its due.

Experts say that given the impact of the Covid pandemic and next year’s election, Suga is likely to focus on domestic issues and the region, and retain Abe’s foreign policy.

There is unlikely to be any loss in transition, since Suga, who served as cabinet secretary through Abe’s tenure, is fully conversant with the government’s policies, and is likely to strengthen partnership with India.

Under Abe, Japan emerged as an important source of overseas development assistance and foreign investment for India.

New Delhi and Tokyo were also working together in Africa, working on alternative supply chains and on a strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific region.

All of this has a bearing on Yoshihide’s economic and regional focus. Besides, the realities of the region — the challenges to the liberal order and Chinese expansionism and aggression — have not changed.

The future of the region demands that India and China continue to work in partnership. India will miss Prime Minister Abe, but the India-Japan relationship is secure.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com
44,Welcome reform on the farm front,"The government has shown remarkable conviction in pushing ahead with three Bills designed to change the operating framework of agriculture in India, even in the face of resignation from the council of ministers of the representative of an old-time ally, the Akali Dal.

This is commendable. The core of the reform sought to be delivered by the Bill is laudable and necessary.

One Bill frees farmers from the grip of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) and gives them marketing freedom. Farmers can have that freedom only if their customers — traders, agro-processing companies — have similar freedom to buy and stock farm produce.

The Bill amending the Essential Commodities Act frees traders from arbitrary stocking limits and the threat of penalties for hoarding. The third Bill seeks to legitimise and regulate contract farming.

All three are interrelated, and, together with the financing plans arranged for post-harvest food-handling infrastructure, promise to give farming in India an incentive to move away from subsistence and towards market orientation.

While the government has sought to assuage farmer anxiety by asserting that minimum support prices (MSPs) are not going to disappear, the fact remains that the logic of the changes proposed, and the compulsions of grain production, storage and international trade, point to phasing out of open-ended procurement at MSP.

The current ridiculous situation of about one-third of the country’s grain output ending up in government stocks, only there to rot or be pilfered, is unsustainable.

Northwest India has to shed over-reliance on grain and diversify production to fruit, flowers, vegetables and other produce, and integrate more stages of value addition into the farmer’s ambit.

The Bill on marketing freedom keeps disputes out of the courts, and depends on the efficacy and fair-mindedness of civil servants for dispute resolution.

That might be neither legally tenable nor desirable. Central legislation on intra-state trade is contentious. An effort to find common ground is in order.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com
45,"Cicero, Erskine, Orwell, Prashant Bhushan: Speaking to power and its consequences","By Santosh Paul

Two thousand and ninety years ago, Marcus Tullius Cicero, the greatest lawyer this world has ever seen, rose to speak on behalf of the people of Sicily. This was a unique legal action under the Roman law. Subjects could file legal actions against Roman governors for bad governance and plunder of their provinces. This case was brought up by the subject peoples of Sicily, then a Roman colony, against Gaelus Verres, the Roman Governor of Sicily. Sicilians were prosecuting him for abusing his power conferred by the Roman Republic and plundering of their land and wealth. Cicero’s orations culminated in the exile Verres. The orations of Cicero against Verres are studied extensively for its oratorical and forensic skills. This episode in history has little to do with the controversy surrounding the guilty verdict and the unprecedented 85 page sentencing order of Prashant Bhushan by the Supreme Court. But it is a valuable study of how the people reserved the power to speak to the power of the Roman Republic at the zenith of its power in 70 BC. Accountable democracy is never static. But there are fundamentals which never change. According to Joseph Schumpeter, “it is an institutional arranged to arrive political decisions, by making the people itself decide issues”. The people have to arrive at decisions which originate in opinions. These opinions and decisions of the people concern the working of all wings of the government which includes the judiciary. After all the functioning of the judiciary affects millions of Indians who are in effect subjects of our constitution and stake holders in governance.

The power the court exercises for criminal contempt is a deviation from the standards of other legal actions. It is an ancient, anachronistic, but a necessary principle, in a narrow sense – that the Superior Court has a peremptory power to punish for contempt. “The usual criminal process to punish contempt was found to be cumbersome and slow, and therefore the courts at an uncertain

date presumed jurisdiction themselves to punish the offence summarily, brevi manu.” [(1765) Wilm 243]. Given the nature of the power and the purpose it seeks to achieve, it is all the more critical that it is exercised carefully and with circumspect and in consonance with the sensibilities of a constitutional democracy.

The power of contempt is overwhelming without much safeguards, procedural or otherwise. It is therefore necessary, that the Court follows not just the routine rule of audi alterum partum. It therefore ought to follow the procedure in both letter and spirit of the law. Following of the mandatory procedure will ensure the exercise of its power without the inviting the opprobrium of having acted belligerently or vindictively. The bypassing of the Attorney General in Prashant Bhushan’s case is not just a procedural impediment given a go by. The Court has axed an important due process safeguard.

In Robertson v. United States ex rel. Watson, a challenge was made to the moving of criminal contempt by private individuals. Chief Justice Roberts thought it imperative to warn against the unbridled freewheeling exercise of the power of initiating contempt, “[t]he terrifying force of the criminal justice system may only be brought to bear against an individual by society as a whole, through a prosecution brought on of behalf of the government.” This ‘terrifying force’ of contempt against Prashant Bhushan must necessarily be exercised in a just manner in line with the democratic traditions of our Constitution.

Does Bhushan’s guilty verdict and his sentencing pass the muster of the tests laid down by Justice P.B.Samant writing for the Supreme Court in 1995? The Supreme Court carefully laid down the markers, “the courts are therefore inherently deemed to have been entrusted with the power to see that the stream of justice in the country remains, that its course is not hindered, or obstructed in any manner, the justice is delivered without fear or favour and for that purpose all the Courts and tribunals are protected while discharging their legitimate duties.” [Vinay Chandra Mishra , (1995) 2 SCC 584]. Following the train of tests laid down in Vinay Chandra, the questions in Prashant Bhushan’s case which begs an answer is (a) did his tweets hinder the stream of justice? (b) did it hinder the course of justice? (c) did it cause any impediment in justice being delivered without fear or favour? The answer is unfortunately a no on all counts.

A comment on the judiciary or its working, like the tweets of Prashant Bhushan, is a criticism of the manner of its functioning. But will that per se constitute a contempt? Afraid not. There is this delicate balance to be maintained between the power of contempt in aiding administration of justice and the maintaining the effective exercise of the freedom of speech and expression. “The court’s duty is to ensure that the conflict between the two does not become too acute. So a balance has to be struck and such balance must rest on a subtle understanding of and the mutual respect for each other’s needs” [A.K.Ganguly J., Kallol Guha Thakurata v. Biman Basu (2005) 2 Cal LT].

Criticism of the judiciary in all functional democracies is treated as a legitimate exercise of free speech. George Orwell wrote a piece on 9 th of March 1938 in the Listener. He made a trenchant comment on the nature and role of British judiciary in colonial establishments like India. “The truth is that every British magistrate in India is in a false position when he has to try a case in which European and native interests clash. In theory he is administering an impartial system of justice; in practice is part of a huge machine that exists to protect British interests, and he has often got to choose between sacrifice his integrity and the damaging his career"" If George Orwell was silenced by a contempt, it would have been a loss not just for literature, but a missed opportunity in course correction for the judiciary in India.

But there is far greater issue at stake here. It has to do with speaking to power and fearlessly so as the Constituent Assembly, overwhelmingly dominated by lawyers, would have always wanted it for India. It would not be out of place to time travel to the trial of Thomas Paine who in his iconic work ‘Rights of Man’ in which he advocated for the overthrow of an unjust government. He was tried for seditious libel. England’s most eminent barrister Thomas Erskine, was pilloried and threatened for having taken up Paine’s brief. His introductory oration is a telling thought on the present times: “I will forever, at all hazards, assert the dignity, independence, and integrity of the English Bar, without which impartial justice, the most valuable part of the English constitution, can have no existence. From the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he will or will not stand between the Crown and the subject arraigned in the court where he daily sits to practise, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end”.

Erskine rightly put it that a lawyer’s right to speak to power is coterminous with the rights of a free people governed by a free constitution. Oscar Wilde from his prison in Reading Goal wrote, “every trial is a trial for a man’s life”. But the trial and sentencing of Prashant Bhushan is a trial which will go down in history as a trial not just for the heart and soul of the legal profession, but also of the fundamental freedoms of the citizens of India.

46,Driving Indo-Pacific in an Uncertain World,"By Dr Prabir De

Indo-Pacific is in the limelight for quite some time now. It is a multipolar region, contributing more than half of the world’s GDP and population. Indo-Pacific is the lifeline of the entire world; world’s one-third flow of trade and energy passes through this region. The motivation for a larger bloc always comes from the sheer size, resources it owns, and the scope and size of the economies of scale that it can generate. Indo-Pacific has everything, but can it culminate into a formal bloc or a region that goes on building a better world?

Indo-Pacific got a new life when ASEAN in June 2019 and India in November 2019 came out with their respective Indo-Pacific visions. Earlier this week, the EU’s current Chair Germany presented the country’s Indo-Pacific strategy, and it is almost certain that the EU will come out with its Indo-Pacific vision soon. Some more countries such as Canada, Sri Lanka and South Africa are expected to launch their Indo-Pacific visions. Figure 1 illustrates countries within and outside the region that introduced Indo-Pacific visions with ASEAN being encouraged to take centre stage due to ASEAN’s most-ready regional architectures like ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit (EAS). Today, countries and regions one after another are pledging to join the league. The immediate question that comes in our mind is how far are we from an Indo-Pacific order?

Richard Baldwin’s 1993 NBER working paper entitled “A Domino Theory of Regionalism”, offers an explanation. The domino effect is simple. When multilateral bodies fail to meet the countries’ expectations, regional integration sweeps the world like a wildfire or tsunami. Why are countries eager to join Indo-Pacific? The proximate answer is that the world is fully aware of the costs of the rise of only one country or a fixed set of countries and that risk must be avoided. A rules-based global order is what the world needs, which is another reason for the rise of Indo-Pacific. This is also caused by two idiosyncratic events multiplied by a domino effect. The triggering events are the US-China trade war and the global pandemic, which has an origin in China.

Richard Baldwin’s paper tenders an interesting analogy. He said, which I quote: “It is all about political equilibria”, which balance anti- and pro-membership forces, determine the country’s stances on the regional programme like Indo-Pacific. Now add economics in it. Business communities (e.g. traders and investors) are always a powerful pro-membership constituency. An event like Indo-Pacific that triggers closer integration within one or multiple existing blocs harms the profits of nonmember exporters, therefore stimulating them to boost their pro-membership (pro-Indo-Pacific) political activity. The extra activity alters the political equilibrium, leading some countries to join. This enlargement further harms nonmember traders and investors since they now face a disadvantage in a greater number of markets. This second wave brings forth more pro-membership political activity and further enlargement of the Indo-Pacific bloc. The new political equilibrium is marked by larger regional trading blocs. In the meantime, regionalism appears to spread like a wildfire. This might replicate in the case of Indo-Pacific.

India’s performance in Indo-Pacific has come out impressive. In India, Indo-Pacific is a benign and transparent initiative. India’s vision Security And Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) has been introduced. PM Modi’s speech at Shangri La Dialogue in 2018 “Free, Open Prosperous and Inclusive Indo–Pacific” has further provided political direction. Besides economic relations, India’s security partnerships with countries in Indo-Pacific such as the US, Japan, Australia and several ASEAN countries, have expanded significantly in recent years. Both Indian External Affairs Minister and Foreign Secretary have kept the Indo-Pacific active, which is concurrently shaping the posture of international affairs. There have been regular meetings, particularly virtual meetings even in this Covid-19 period.

In 2019, ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP) was introduced by ASEAN, and India has introduced the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI). These two versions have added further fillip to the emerging Indo-Pacific construct. India-Japan Vision Statement dated 29 October 2018 has also provided crucial political support to Indo-Pacific. While highlighting the criticality of finding common solutions by working together, Prime Minister Modi proposed at the 14th East Asia Summit an IPOI for addressing challenges and ensuring a safe, secure and stable maritime domain.

With the announcement of the AOIP and IPOI in 2019, Indo-Pacific has started receiving attention globally. As an open global initiative, the IPOI draws on existing regional cooperation architecture and mechanisms to focus on seven central pillars conceived around Maritime Security; Maritime Ecology; Maritime Resources; Capacity Building and Resource Sharing; Disaster Risk Reduction and Management; Science, Technology and Academic Cooperation; and Trade Connectivity and Maritime Transport. AOIP and IPOI show commonalities and also the scope of cooperation, particularly in view of unfolding global order in the backdrop of ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. The National Maritime Foundation (NMF) of India came out with the first ever Indo-Pacific Report in 2019. A good set of literature on Indo-Pacific is needed to strengthen its intellectual base.

The success of the regional initiative also depends on bilateral as well as subregional relations. In July 2019, India joined ACMECS (Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy) as a Development Partner along with Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and the US.

Indo-Pacific has all ingredients to facilitate trade and investments. However, the region is highly heterogeneous in terms of economic size and level of development, with significant differences in security establishments and resources. It also faces complex challenges in terms of economy, security and the environment. The maintenance of peace, stability and security in seas; unimpeded lawful commerce; freedom of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the oceanic and air space; and the protection and preservation of marine resources, as well as a sustainable and responsible fishery–framework, are all critical towards building a regional consensus on maritime security and cooperation in Indo-Pacific.

In a recent paper published in Journal of Economic Structures, this author along with Mohammad Masudur Rahman and Chanwahn Kim (“Indo-Pacific cooperation: What do trade simulations indicate?”, Journal of Economic Structures, Vol. 9, No. 45, 2020) has investigated the potential economic effect of ‘Indo-Pacific’ regional economic cooperation and compares with the extended CPTPP. The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) results show that the quadrilateral alliance between the US, Japan, Australia, and India shows although a substantial economic gain whilst South and East Asia join with the Indo-Pacific cooperation, the economic benefit would be enormous. The findings also indicate that South and East Asian improved trade facilitation could bring huge gain as a large part of Indo-Pacific trade has remained unrealised. The trade transaction cost is one of the major trading barriers prohibiting the growth of Indo-Pacific intra-regional trade. This paper reinforces that improvement in infrastructure and connectivity that leads to less trade transportation costs should be a necessary step to realise Indo-Pacific trade potential.

The recent special issue of the Journal of Asian Economic Integration (JAEI), entitled “Indo-Pacific: A New Paradigm”, presents six freshly written research articles by eminent scholars on Indo-Pacific. These six papers review critical aspects of Indo-Pacific, from concept to sectoral dynamics to country and regional narratives. This is the first publication of a special issue on Indo-Pacific by any frontline publisher. For example, Takenori Horimoto in his paper entitled “Indo-Pacific Order and Japan-India Relations in the Midst of Covid-19” has called for stronger cooperation between Japan and India to maintain peace and stability in Indo-Pacific regional order. He has suggested the creation of a free, open, inclusive, and democratic Indo-Pacific. There should be some mechanisms based on principles of multilateralism, e.g. Quad-Plus, not only involving the four countries: like-minded countries should also be included. In this way, we can find a silver lining beyond Covid-19.

With countries from ASEAN, SAARC, BIMSTEC, EAS, EU and NAFTA joining the group, this free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific is likely to scale up the regional development in post-Covid, provided countries do not repeat their mistakes in existing regional cooperation initiatives and devote quality time to build a better world for all. Security is not the only vehicle for the diffusion of integration, rather the most important mechanism is geographical and cultural proximity. Besides, it is the economy that would drive the Indo-Pacific in coming days.

Indo-Pacific countries have ample scope for further deepening the integration process in this Covid-19 period. Strengthening the economic integration requires a shared strategic vision, political will and strong commitment, which are the keys for the success of Indo-Pacific. Without doubt, ASEAN centrality would be a major driving force for speeding up cooperation within Indo-Pacific. Multi-dimensional regional cooperation within Indo-Pacific would not only foster economic relations but would, in addition, strengthen regional capacity and enhance regional capability while dealing with the region’s complex security challenges. To drive the initiative in this era of disruptions, Indo-Pacific countries, who have introduced their respective visions, may call a Ministerial meeting and a Summit thereafter. A JWG may be formed to design the Indo-Pacific blueprint and a POA suitably.

47,Digital Equity – The next 25 years of Mobility services in India,"By Faisal Kawoosa

On 31st July 2020 India completed 25 years of mobile services. Like many other accomplishments, one could argue, it’s nothing special and just a journey over a time horizon.

However, there is a fundamental shift in the socio-economic structure of the country as a consequence of mobile journey which we have seen over the past 25 years and still continues to.

From addressing the basic need to communicate, mobile services have come a long way. Today, mobile phones are the omni-companion of every other citizen. So much so, that many even don’t go to rest rooms without taking their phone along.

A lot has been achieved over this period. We have over a billion subscribers availing one of the most affordable services in the world. It is gradually moving beyond connecting people to connecting people-machines as well as connecting machines-machines. Effectively, any form of communication between two end-points is happening over a mobile service. After making the device which is used to communicate ‘smart’, today mobility services are all geared to add this tag of being ‘smart’ with almost everything. Concepts like Smart City would not even have been proposed if mobility services as enablers had not been there.

Now, the way this digital infrastructure is getting deployed in the country is leading to a new level of digital divide. The early definition of digital divide differentiated between people having access to digital services, with those who didn’t have the channels to connect. Recognising this fact, many policy interventions and strategic roadmaps have been put in place over the past 25 years with the central theme of deploying infrastructure and expanding the footprints. As a result, we have mammoth expansion projects like BharatNet which continue to be on with staggering outlay. The premise of these programmes is policy interventions over the period of time which have ‘supply side’ fundamentals. This means if we enable people with the infrastructure things will fall in place and everything else will follow.

This approach has led to a new form of digital divide. This new digital divide is about creation of two contrast views of the market. On one side we have consumers having access to multiple options and enjoying the benefits of a free market. It is a complete monopoly where consumers don’t have a say. This is primarily the result of our overemphasis on enabling access and assuming things will evolve on their own after that. However, that is not the case.

Its impact is seen much on the public sector telecom operators MTNL and BSNL, who have been on this national duty of enabling access without actually getting into the contours of the markets they operate in. As a consequence, MTNL has not been able to meet up to the expectations set in cosmopolitan markets where customer is really the king.

On the other side, BSNL has not been able to earn the adequate RoI as its enablement of access to digital services did not necessarily mean business. The only operator after BSNL / MTNL which attempted to go pan India in true sense is Jio and now it has also started to face that threshold where enabling access alone doesn’t work. Its ‘2G Mukt Bharat’ ambition is not only ambitious but challenging as well.

Whether public sector or private, the operators have over these 25 years primarily focussed on equality where the premise has been that they need to bring as many as possible subscribers under the umbrella of the network and thereafter markets will develop on their own. In reality, it does not work that way. This is what has to change to trigger a sustainable and rewarding Digital India, where there is equity and does not result in ‘Digital Elitism’.

Technology has a cost and it does result in creation of segments and layers based on affordability and needs of the customers. But some of the technologies like access to digital communication cannot have the same approach. The new definition of digital divide which we can see in the market is a consequence of the ‘supply’ approach adopted by the telecom sector for the past 25 years. The sector is not to be blamed for this. Perhaps, it was the need of the hour where focus was more on enablement.

However, enablement alone cannot lead to empowerment. Technology is no longer a building block, a tool, which needs to be merely provisioned and then left to consumers to build on that. There is a need for a paradigm shift and think from more of a ‘demand’ side approach in the telecom services over the next 25 years.

In fact, if we look at 5G as a technology, globally we have already started to hit a roadblock in terms of extracting the incremental value out of this next generation of LTE. That is why, for the first time, the entire telecom value chain has started talking about use cases much ahead of technology even being deployed. This time, with 5G no one just wants to go ahead in the dark. Everyone wants to have an assurance in terms of the real value consumers are going to get for which they will be overwhelmingly ready to pay. In every sector, with new technology being introduced the earnings potential increases either through premium pricing or by bringing in efficiencies in the system to minimise wastages. It is absolutely contrasting in case of telecom services in India, where ARPUs are eroding with the addition of incremental generation of LTE. 5G is a non-starter with this trend.

The vision document for next 25 years of Indian telecommunications has to be based on ‘Digital Equity’, where the focus is not merely providing access but understanding the needs of consumers and offering solutions.

The telecommunications industry has to exactly understand the requirements of the consumers in India across urban, semi-urban, rural, hinterlands as well as through all possible segmentations based on socio-economic demographics and create a social change through equity model that shall lead to equality.

Unless this approach is adopted, the benefits of digital cannot be harnessed to the full potential. The telecom layer will get deployed over the uneven structure of the society which will result in uneven development of the sector.

Telecom will not just drive the communications industry going forward. It is going to be the core over which social, economic and political activities will develop ushering not just to Digital Economy, but Digital Living. As we celebrate the glorious 25 years of mobility services in India, this is the time to rise up and extensively drive research, thought-leadership and dialogues to peep into the future and lay the foundation of a magnificent telecom sector in the country that will in essence drive everything.

India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the world, in which about 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh become crippled.

Several cases of accidents reported in 2019

In yet another shocking case of public apathy and obsession with clicking pictures, a man bled to death because no one bothered to take him to a hospital.



In yet another incident, in Odisha’s Bhadrak district, a man lay in a pool of blood and lost his while as commuters and passersby engaged in making videos and clicking pictures of a victim at on NH-16.

A cement-laden truck had hit a motorcycle on which two people were travelling. Both of them fell from the two-wheeler and the truck ran over the pillion rider leaving him critically injured, according to a report by OdishaBytes.

Member of Road Safety Committee in the district Atish Kumar Behera told OdishaBytes, “Looking at the indifferent attitude of the passersby, we have pasted banners and posters in RTO, the Collector’s office and other public places announcing a cash reward of Rs 2000 for volunteers who take such accident victims to the hospital.”",http://www.indiatimes.com
66,M.S. Swaminathan’s Genetic Engineering Unleashed India's Green Revolution,"India is a farming nation. In rural areas, a majority of the population survives on farming. And this has not only enabled us to feed our stomachs but in some cases also export food to the world.

According to IBEF, India is among the 15 leading exporters of agricultural products in the world. Moreover, agricultural exports from India reached US$ 38.54 billion in 2019 and US$ 28.93 billion in 2020 (until January 2020).

So clearly, it is a considerable chunk for India. However, this wasn’t always the case. In fact, there was a time when India was suffering from famines and yields so low, that the nation was forced to import food from other nations. All this changed, due to the Green Revolution in India, and it’s all thanks to M.S Swaminathan -- the father of Indian Green Revolution.

Hailing from Tamil Nadu

M.S. Swaminathan or Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan was born on August 7, 1925 in the region of Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu. His father, Dr. M.K. Sambasivan was a surgeon by profession. After completing his basic schooling, he decided to enter the field of medicine,

He eventually went ahead to complete his graduation in the field of biology at Maharaja’s College in Trivandrum in Kerala and earned a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Zoology.

However at the same time -- around 1943 -- he witnessed the Great Bengal Famine where he saw the plight of Indians starving for food. He wanted to make a difference, so he decided to make the switch from the field of medicine to agriculture. He enrolled in Madras Agricultural College and completed another graduate degree, this time in Agricultural Science.

Stepping out of India for academics

In 1947, he joined Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi as a post-graduate student and learned about genetics and plant breeding. He later became a UNESCO fellow, researching on potato genetics at Wageningen Agricultural University, Institute of Genetics in the Netherlands. He learned how to transfer genes from wild species of Solanum to the cultivated potato species Solanum tuberosum.

In the year 1950, he was a part of the Cambridge School of Agriculture where he earned his doctorate in Philosophy. He later accepted a post doctoral research associateship with the University of Wisconsin, Department of Genetics where he helped in setting up of a USDA potato research station. Here he was also offered a full-time faculty, which he gracefully declined, to come back to India in 1954.

The Green Revolution

In India, he put his learnings into practice and started to teach Indian farmers to effectively increase the production of their yield with the help of high-yielding wheat varieties, fertilisers and advanced farming techniques that put less strain on farmers.

Reuters

In 1960, he collaborated with Norman Borlaug and other scientists to develop HYV or High Yielding Variety seeds of Wheat which he encouraged farmers around the nation to adopt. In the year 1965, Swaminathan set up thousands of demonstrations in the northern part of our nation to show small-scale farmers how genetically modified grains can help grow better yields in the same fields. This was game-changing as in the first year, the harvest tripled previous production levels.

Swaminathan educated farmers to adopt these new methods overlapping the barriers of illiteracy and lack of formal education. Due to his efforts, the average crop yield of 12 million tons spiked to 23 million tons in just a matter of four crop seasons.

Reuters

Swaminathan later collaborated with then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to establish agricultural policies and programmes to help the nation stay self-sufficient in the field of agriculture for years to come.

Swaminathan was the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1979-1980. Before this, he served as the Director-General of Indian Council of Agricultural research from 1972-1979. He has also been a part of the Planning Commission -- in charge of agriculture and rural development from 1980 to 1982.

Awards and achievements

For his efforts in solving the problem of hunger in India, he was awarded Padma Shri in the year 1967, followed by a Padma Bhushan in 1972 and Padma Vibhushan in the year 1989.

Swaminathan is the recipient of the World Food Prize of 1987. He has also been made president of the Pugwash Conferences on science and world affairs.",https://www.indiatimes.com
67,Hyderabad Schoolgirl's Paintings To Be Used In A Restaurant In London,"Art knows no religion, no borders.

Getting recognition for their art is the only thing an artist wants, and for this 14-year-old schoolgirl from Hyderabad, appreciation has come big.

Syeda Ashna Turabi impressed a British businessman with her art, to the point that he bought six of her paintings to put up in his restaurant in South London.

Facebook

The British man came across Ashna's paintings on Facebook where her father had uploaded them.

Ashna's father, Urooj Turabi, told news agency ANI that he was proud of his daughter's talent. He added that he will continue to support her and encourage her so that her work can be recognised further on an international level.

Facebook

The restaurant which will display her paintings is in South London and is named Adeena's Kitchen. It will serve Hyderabadi food and Ashna's Five to six feet tall paintings will decorate the place.

Ashna is a student of Class 10. Now, she wants to make a whole series of paintings on Indian culture and heritage. She said, “I am planning to do a series of paintings on various subjects. Through these series, I will try to explore Indian culture and will conduct an exhibition of my artworks in the future.”

68,"Scientists Find New Method To Convert CO2 Into Ethylene Used In Plastics, Cosmetics","In an effort to put carbon dioxide to use, a team of researchers has come up with a way to convert carbon dioxide into ethylene, an important chemical used in the production of plastics, cosmetics and several other useful products.

Developed by scientists from Caltech and the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, the new CO2 conversion method promises to “efficiently turn greenhouse gases into value-added fuels.” The method can ultimately be used to curb the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

For the novel conversion process, the scientists developed nanoscale copper wires with specially shaped surfaces that are able to catalyse a chemical reaction that eats up the carbon dioxide. The greenhouse gas instead produces ethylene through the chemical reaction.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

Yu-Huang, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at UCLA, said, “Developing materials that can efficiently turn greenhouse gases into value-added fuels and chemical feedstocks is a critical step to mitigate global warning while turning away from extracting increasingly limited fossil fuels.”



William Goddard, Caltech’s Charles and Mary Ferkel Professor of Chemistry, Materials Science, and Applied Physics added, “The idea of using copper to catalyse this reaction has been around for a long time, but the key is to accelerate that rate, so it is fast enough for industrial production.”

“This study shows a solid path towards that mark, with the potential to transform ethylene production into a greener industry using carbon dioxide that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere.”

Overcoming challenges

There were two known challenges to the use of copper to reduce carbon dioxide into ethylene reaction. First, the initial chemical reaction also procured hydrogen and methane. Second, previous attempts at ethylene production through such a method did not last long.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

In order to overcome those issues, the researchers devised a unique design of the copper nanowires. The new design is said to have high active steps – similar to a set of stairs, only at an atomic scale.



In their research, scientists observed that the step pattern was able to remain stable under the reaction conditions. This further enhances the system’s durability as well as its selectivity in producing ethylene.

The team was able to achieve a carbon dioxide-to-ethylene conversion rate of greater than 70 percent, which is much more efficient than the previous designs. The new system was able to run for 200 hours with a consistent conversion efficiency.",https://www.indiatimes.com
69,"Freelance Journo, Chinese Woman, Nepalese Man Arrested For Passing On Classified Info To China","A Delhi-based freelance journalist and two foreign nationals have been arrested by the Delhi Police for allegedly passing sensitive information about India's border strategy and Army deployment to Chinese intelligence.

The journalist, Rajeev Sharma who was writing on defence-related issues for some Indian media organisations, as well as China's Global Times was arrested by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police September 14 based on inputs from central intelligence.

ani

Police have seized classified defence documents from him.

'He had classified information'

""He was found to be in possession of some classified defence-related documents. The investigation is in progress and further details will be shared in due course,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav had said.

A Chinese woman and her Nepalese associate have also been arrested for allegedly paying Sharma large amounts of money routed through shell companies.

ani

At a press conference, Special Cell DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said Sharma was contacted by Chinese Intelligence agents in 2016. Sharma was also in contact with some Chinese intelligence officers, adding the freelance journalist got Rs 40 lakh in one-and-a-half years and he was getting USD 1,000 for each information.

ani

The development comes at a time when India is stepping up its efforts to counter China's attempts to spy on the country and its citizens by collecting electronic data.

Last month, following the arrest of a Chinese national Luo Sang, also known as Charlie Peng for running a hawala network it was revealed that he was paying Buddhist monks to spy on the Dalai Lama, who escaped from Tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising there against Chinese rule and now lives in India.

India has also banned hundreds of Chinese mobile apps which the government says are a threat to national security.

70,Govt Says It Doesn't Have Record Of Number Of MSMEs That Shut During Lockdown,"The central government received a lot of criticism during the early stages of the lockdown for neglecting migrant workers. It garnered criticism again for claiming that it has no data on the deaths of migrant workers.

More recently, the government also said it did not have any data on the number of healthcare workers that died during COVID.

And now the centre has claimed there's no record of the number of medium and small businesses (MSME) that have closed during the pandemic.

Pratap Chandra Sarangi was asked about the number of small and medium businesses that closed shop from March to August 2020. The Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) replied in a statement to Rajya Sabha, ‘COVID-19 epidemic has temporarily affected various sectors including micro, small scale enterprises which also affected job scenario. No such record is available’.

In addition he said, there was no data on the number of MSMEs closed down from FY 2014-15 to FY 2019-20 either.

Starring the effervescent Mouni Roy as an undercover RAW Agent Uma and Purab Kohli as her co-worker, 'London Confidential' kicks off with a post-COVID-19 world where world leaders and scientists are all set to attend the Conference of New Viruses in London. But that’s just the sub-plot.

ZEE5

This 70-minute spy thriller is based on an ambitious concept by conspiracy thriller churner S Hussain Zaidi. This intriguing plot only thickens with the introduction of new characters. The movie also stars Purab Kohli, Kulraj Randhawa, Pravessh Rana and Sagar Arya in pivotal roles. While there have been many movies based on an unexplained virus pandemic, ‘London Confidential’ is definitely the first to explore this angle during an on-going global pandemic. The movie sure does pave the way for many more thrillers to work against this intriguing premise.



At the very start of the movie, we find out that RAW’s London Station has discovered some incriminating evidence against the Chinese Government and the spread of a new virus. As the team gets closer to unearthing the truth, a series of Indian agents are brutally killed, leading the team to question the presence of a mole in their team.





The cinematographer did an effortless job to bring out the emotion that the cast is feeling on screen. We feel even moment of panic, shock and confusion that the characters experience during the movie. The entire cast has given stellar performances and the two lead actors balance each other out well.

Mouni Roy who is making her digital debut with this film with the lead role manages to showcase the anxiety that comes with being a RAW agent in a post-COVID world as well as the struggles that come with being pregnant and in a rocky marriage during such times. Purab Kohli provides the much needed moments of humour and the duo manage to carry the movie on their shoulders with ease.

‘London Confidential’ was shot by director Kanwal Sethi is the first OTT film made in London post-lockdown. The director made sure that the audience was able to relate to the world they have showcased in the movie. They not only bring out the stress and anxiety that comes with living after a pandemic but also how day-to-day lives have been drastically altered.

ZEE5

Even though the movie is set in the post-pandemic era, the opening montage of people stepping out in masks sets the tone of the modern-day London still reeling from the after-shocks of a global pandemic.

73,4 Moments That Made Binge-Watching MX Player's 'Aashram' A Super-Fun Experience,"In the past few years, we have seen Prakash Jha produce many political masterpieces like Gangajal and Rajneeti for the big screen but when he forayed into the digital space, he decided to take it one step further.

MX Player’s Aashram is the perfect starting point for Jha as he begins his digital journey. A series that sheds light on the real face on Indian god-men who take advantage of the people who put their belief in them is a directorial masterpiece made complete with exceptional performances.

While binge-watching the series, there are many moments that stood out in the 9 episodes, but here are a few that made the show an all-round experience:

1. Bobby Deol, Bobby Deol, Bobby Deol:

Bobby Deol (Monty/Kashipur Waale Baba) has made a comeback to the mainstream as he plays a godman in Aashram. His innocent yet unsettling smile adds to his character.

MX Player

His acting prowess really comes through as he juggles between the two faces that his character carries. He showcases true poise and calm when talking to his devotees but the true deviousness really comes through when we see him being manipulative with politicians and his right hand, Bhopa.

2. Murders, Skeletons And More:

Mx Player’s Aashram is the perfect amalgamation of corruption, politics and mystery. The show shows a skeleton being dug up from the ground pretty early on into it and the suspense that follows it is thrilling, to say the least.

A woman’s skeleton is found on the outskirts of Kashipur, which leads to a cop (played by Darshan Kumaar) digging deeper into this case. Ujagar Singh (Darshan Kumaar) is the only force that stands in the way of the Aashram, he is a bitter and cynical inspector who has lost his faith in the justice system.



MX Player

A big change-over comes in his life when he meets Dr Natasha (Anupriya Goenka) - a righteous postmortem specialist while investigating a skeleton case. Supported by her strong sense of morality, it is his sheer determination and courage that spurs him to bring the criminals involved in this case to justice. This cat and mouse game gets more interesting as more and more con is exposed from behind the Aashram walls.

3. An Aashram That Saves No One:

On the outside, this aashram is the divine place where people in need come looking for guidance but in reality, it is crawling with injustices. For instance, Pammi’s brother Satti (Tushar Pandey) is married to a sex worker (Tridha Chaudhary). But when Kashipur Waale Baba gets a look at the wife’s beauty, he manipulates Satti into getting a castration just so he can send him away and be able to take advantage of the wife.

MX Player

Exploiting women, keeping them caged and ill-treating women is a common practice at the aashram This is made pretty clear from the first scene where we see Pammi fighting her way out and then again when Kavita is locked in a cellar jail.

4. Drugs, Prostitution and Endless Power:

The series shows how much power god-men hold in this country. From cops to politicians to even the narcotics department is on Baba Ji’s payroll somehow which makes it even more interesting. He is able to get a drugged up Punjabi rapper on his side by getting narcs involved and then just rescuing him like a literal god.

MX Player

The true power that Baba Ji has is manipulation and deceit which he does with such ease that he might as well be sitting on a pedestal as hundreds prayed to him. The show is shot in such grandeur that every scene has a purpose and emotion behind it.

MX Player’s Aashram is one of the best shows to come out this year and these are only a few reasons why it deserves all the praise. So, if you haven’t watched it yet, I suggest you spend the weekend getting to know the corrupt world of Prakash Jha’s Aashram on MX Player now!",https://www.indiatimes.com

75,"Prakash Jha's Digital Debut, Ashram Is A Bingeworthy Mix Of Incredible Performances & Engaging Plot Lines","In India, the power held by godmen is common knowledge. While we’ve read a lot about the shady dealings of these ungodly godmen, we’ve never had any conversation about the societal problems which have led to their rise to prominence.

Prakash Jha’s Aashram is an honest look at society at large which paves way for these conmen to strengthen their empires. Jha’s first full-fledged dive into the web content space comes with a brilliantly woven story which highlights the societal problems and how this cycle of suffering never ends for the oppressed.

Here's what makes it an engaging watch:

A Gripping Storyline:

The show is pretty upfront with its showcase of casteism. In fact, the show starts with a local incident where people from the lower caste are beaten up. What follows is a great maze of subplots, shady characters, grand schemes and a whole lot of politics.

Aashram, at its core, is about the faith of the masses. When the common folk have their trust in the system broken, they start believing a godman over those who are supposed to protect them. With such blind faith, people are quick to overlook the obvious traps they are walking into.





A lower-caste girl, Pammi (Aaditi Pohankar), is a champion wrestler but she is constantly discriminated against. When the safety of her family is put at risk, she finds justice in the form of a godman. The godman and his followers become a symbol of hope. Even the ‘good guys’ in the plot have some deep flaws. For example, Sub-inspector Ujagar Singh (Darshan Kumaar) is an honest cop who is contemptuous of a colleague because he is said to have benefitted from the reservation system.

Unparalleled Performances:

All the characters fall in the perfect grey area for Prakash Jha to explore as the audience is treated to one of the most engaging bits of storytelling in the Indian webseries space.

Bobby Deol (Monty/Kashipur Waale Baba) has made a comeback to the mainstream as he plays a godman in Aashram. His innocent yet unsettling smile adds to his character.

MX Player

Other actors include Chandan Roy who plays Bhupinder alias Bhopa, Baba’s trusted aide who doubles up as his trouble-shooter, hitman and key interlocutor. With strong performances by Aaditi Pohankar (last seen in the web-series She), Chandan Roy Sanyal, Anupriya Goenka, Tridha Choudhury, Sachin Shroff, Tushar Pandey and Vikram Kochchar, it’s great to see the webseries ecosystem thrive with a bunch of recognisable actors.

Direction And Production That Keep You Hooked:

One of the major challenges for a show set in a small city is to not let the immersion of the setting break. Prakash Jha manages to keep this show on track with his brilliant direction. The way he manages to steer our attention to a lot of significant sub-plots is commendable.

The use of natural lighting produces great results and the sequence in the police station highlights that. The dialect is on-point and the world created in the show is a reflection of our society.

MX Player

There are nine episodes in the series - each roughly an hour long. With around nine hours of content, Aashram manages to give us a satisfying end to sub-plots and character arcs. With tense cliff-hangers, it was difficult to not start the next episode right away.

The good thriller always reveals its plot in layers. With little chunks of information dropping every few minutes, the overarching sense of despair makes for a riveting watch.

Prakash Jha’s Aashram is nothing but binge-worthy and deserves your dedicated attention this weekend, so start streaming it on MX Player now!",https://www.indiatimes.com

89,Chronicle Of A Pandemic Foretold,"

The coronavirus pandemic has prompted people to recall a number of functional scenarios that narrate apocalyptic events. One of the best known of these is Stephen King’s 1978 magnum opus, ‘The Stand,’ which, in its full-length version, runs into 1,703 pages and deals with a deadly pathogen which kills over 98 percent of the world’s population.



Perhaps one of the earliest fictional accounts of a global threat that wipes out all forms of life is Arthur Conan Doyle’s ‘The Poison Belt,’ which features the scientific genius, Professor Challenger, and was written in 1913.



From the astronomical data he has collected and analysed, Challenger deduces that our planet, spinning through space, is shortly to pass through a zone of ether, a gas commonly used by the medical profession of the time as a general anesthetic, which can be lethal as an overdose.



With his warnings falling on the deaf ears of a heedless officialdom, Challenger decides, in the true spirit of scientific enquiry, to shut himself up with a couple of his close associates in a hermetically sealed room in his Sussex house.



According to the calculations he has made, the world should pass through the ether belt within a span of 24 hours or so.



By keeping himself and his companions safe from the effects of the gas for that period of time, Challenger wants to prove to his own satisfaction that he has calculated correctly and that the planet would transit through the ether in 24 hours. If he has miscalculated, when he and his friends unseal the room and breathe the outside air – for they have no intention of staying locked up in indefinite isolation – they will also inhale the gas and perish, along with all the other inhabitants of the planet.At the appointed hour, Challenger flings open a window – and they breathe in clean, fresh morning air. The poison belt has been safely passed. The small band of survivors ventures into London and sees people, carriage horses, lying on the roadside, crashed automobiles with dead drivers slumped over their steering wheels.Challenger and his companions face the terrifying prospect of being the only living beings in a dead world.Then, slowly, the ‘dead’, humans and animals, begin to stir and come back to life. The ether rendered them unconscious but did not kill them. Though there were fatal accidents, such as car and train crashes, the human race survives, as do other living species.The book ends with Challenger summing up the near-extinction as a somber warning from the Cosmos to humankind which, in its endless quest for greater and greater technological advancement, and its desire to dominate nature, oversteps the boundaries of its own limitations and becomes a threat not only to itself, but to all life.Challenger likens the poison belt to a disinfectant that the Creator, in the role of a watchful gardener, used, to cleanse the grape of Planet Earth from the undesirable fungus of human arrogance and lust for power.It’s a haunting image, which, more than a century after it was evoked, is all the more relevant in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.Except, this time, the poison belt it not out there. It’s within us. What disinfectant, not just of the body, but of the spirit, can be devised to exorcise the toxin within?That’s the real challenge.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus
90,How to connect despite physical distancing,"How each of us copes with lockdowns, social distancing and work-from-home routine – to prevent further spread of the Covid-19 pandemic – will vary from person to person. Some will be anxious, stressed, panicked or fearful; others more accepting and peaceful. However, what we feel radiates out, affecting others. So what can we do to lessen the stress? How can we enrich our sense of community without physical contact?



I will share with you here a very potent form of communication – the ability to connect heart-to-heart – that works, despite physical distance. We can send love from wherever we are to anyone, anywhere, anytime:



Sit comfortably and gently close your eyes. Bring the person you wish to send love to, in front of you. Feel your heart connecting to their heart. Gently send love and care to the person from your heart to their heart. Feel connected.



The news is full of stories of tension between couples, between children and parents, and between the elderly and other family members.



How can we face the cabin fever we are experiencing during the lockdown? Perhaps this being together is an opportunity to accept each other’s imperfections, and strengthen our emotional connections. Today our human community is global – and viruses, of course, don’t respect national boundaries – yet many of us are lonelier than ever. This is a chance for us to reboot ourselves.Why not read one chapter of a book together and have a discussion? We have time now to work on our lifestyle choices. Digital technologies are important for us to stay connected, but we can also take breaks from screen time and cultivate more family time. Enjoy a song or meditate together, watch a movie, share meals, and tell each other jokes. When family members meditate together, it forms a very strong and deep bond. The connection, joy and humour we feel, will dissolve the pain. I am not trying to deny or downplay the severity of the current situation – we need to accept reality and act accordingly. Do not ignore the cautionary guidelines already in place.Experiment with lifestyle choices. There are so many habits that could simplify our lives, like conserving groceries, fasting and being careful about finances rather than indulging in panic buying. There are also many tasks we normally don’t find time for at home, like spring-cleaning. We can explore our creative talents, learn new skills and cultivate healthy habits. We can help our elders, and those who are less fortunate. We can be kind to others, and volunteer in our communities, while being careful to prevent spread of the virus. Especially during a lockdown, a regular daily routine will be immensely beneficial.If you would like to experience inner stillness, peace and joy, take refuge from the outer world in the stillness of your heart. Your heart is the doorway to a world of wonder and wisdom, feeling and connection. Heartfulness practices offer protection in your energetic structure, even if they are not a remedy for everything. When we stay connected in the heart, prayerfully, we create a vibration of love around us. When we purify our consciousness, we dissolve the negative thought pollution around us. Let this unusual and challenging time be an opportunity for every one of us to recalibrate our lifestyle.

91,Is Your Cough Infectious?,"Psychologists say that 90% of our activities happen as a result of self-hypnosis. A man coughs and suddenly, many others start coughing. Until now you were sitting quietly, there was no trace of any coughing, but one man coughs and you are suddenly reminded of coughing. With that reminder, hypnosis catches hold of you and your throat begins to itch. Now you are bound to cough. This was a suggestion, it functioned like a spell, and now you will follow it.



Psychologists also say that the role of germs in this situation is secondary, the role of hypnosis is primary; that is what makes people sick or healthy. Your body functions in obedience to the commands of your mind. Even now, at this very moment, if the body falls sick, it is only because it is obeying the mind, and when it is healthy, it is only obeying the mind. When it becomes old, it is only obeying the mind. In living and even in dying, it has your full agreement and command. When old people die, the deep reason behind it is that the moment they start getting old, they start wishing for death. Young people don’t usually die, and the basic reason behind it is not their youth, the reason is that they don’t think about dying.



Death is less of a physical phenomenon and more of a psychological one.Hindu scriptures have called this maya, hypnosis. Whatsoever you are doing, whatsoever you are, whatsoever your mental state, is all your hypnosis. If you are happy, if you are unhappy, it is all your hypnosis, but your unawareness of it makes it very difficult for you to change it. If someone is unhappy and you tell him that he is only hypnotized about being unhappy, he will not agree with you because he cannot change it.But if you try some experiments with hypnosis, you will be amazed: if you hypnotise a person and then put an onion in his hand and tell him that it is an apple, he just might eat it and say that it is an apple.This ability of the mind is called maya. In this hypnosis, the world that people create together is almost magical. The world that we are living in is our own magic. We are crying and weeping and screaming in pain. Or this happiness is happening, and that joy is happening, and this trouble and that difficulty…. It is all your own magic, and the key to it is in your own hands.

92,New Doorway To Introspection,"Instead of feeling stifled under the lockdown, SHAMMI PARANJAPE suggests we take this opportunity to do some soul-searching



With lockdowns, isolation, quarantine and social distancing being practised all over India and also in some other parts of the world in the wake of the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic, this is a good opportunity to make full use of seclusion to go in, from out. To do this is possible only in stillness and seclusion, and by force of circumstances, nature has, though in a harsh and relentless way, brought us to it. We need to utilise this time for introspection and soul-searching.



The primary principle of Nature is balance. When this balance is disrupted, there is temporary chaos and readjustment. Also, as human beings, we have failed in our moral duty to the planet. Now we are forced to do it. Call it the law of natural ethics. When a tipping point is reached, a power mightier than all the combined strength of humankind, starts operating.



Our disconnect with our higher Self made us ignore our responsibility towards two deadly ‘viruses’ that have already been raging for a while on our planet. These are virus of ‘excesses’ and the virus of ‘hunger.’



Deadly as these viruses are, they have got scant attention.



The hunger-virus, or virus of the poor, afflicts and kills millions. Thousands starve and go to bed hungry whereas some among the affluent throw wasted food in the garbage bin. Minimal effort has been given to mitigate this callousness against humanity.The other virus — excesses brought on by ‘affluenza’ — has upset the ecological balance. To earn a decent amount for family and self, to lead happy and healthy lives is the common goal of all people. But, somewhere, the equation has gone askew. Enough is never enough, as greed has taken over, leading to imbalance and degradation of the environment.It is being reported that the current pandemic was possibly triggered by mishandling of and consumption of unusual animals like bats. If this is true, then it is perhaps a good time to rethink what we eat. Sri Sathya Sai Baba says, “Your body is a shrine, not a burial place for innocent animals.”He further elaborates that humans are no longer cavemen who need to hunt for meat, to consume it for survival. We have come a long way and have changed many of our habits to suit the need of the times. He further says that consuming the flesh of animals passes on negative qualities and also the fear animals experience when they are slaughtered. Many healthy eating options are available. This being the case, why eat animals? ■",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus
93,CORONA KARMA?,"ACHARYA GYANSAGAR and monk ANITA DIDI discuss corona, karma, merit and traditional hygiene practices with SONAL SRIVASTAVA



We often come across the comment, ‘corona is karma’ on social media. The phrase loosely refers to human actions as being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic. The virus spiral reportedly began in China where bats are consumed as food. In such a scenario, it becomes imperative for us to explore the ancient karma theory in the current context. One among the three main karmic religions in the subcontinent, Jain dharma accepts karma as a yardstick of the natural justice system and has a well-developed philosophical structure that helps us understand how karma works

.

“There is individual karma and then there is collective karma. Collective karma, that is all our karma put together, influences everybody. When we do good deeds as a society, then we also reap collective merit. It is our collective paap karma (negative actions) that we are being affected by coronavirus.” So says Anita Didi, monk-disciple of Acharya Gyansagar, who is presently camping in Baran, a town in Rajasthan.



“We have to try to understand the Jain karma siddhanta, principle.



We get fruits according to the karma we do and the intention with which we perform actions. Rishis have said that there are kashayas, passions, desires, that result in our manifesting anything in this world. Their intensity varies; they can be tivra, fast, or madhya, medium kashayas,” says Gyansagarji, explaining the different aspects of the Jain view of karma. “Our suffering depends on the tenacity of our kashayas and our individual karma. Each one of us experiences suffering differently. To get over one’s bad karma, one has to do pashchatap, penance. Merit can be accumulated by worshipping tirthankaras, and by contemplating on their teachings. The most important thing is to have karuna bhava, compassion, towards all living beings and to do seva in whichever way we can,” says Gyansagarji, talking about ways to accumulate merit. “We must also ask for forgiveness, if knowingly or unknowingly we have hurt somebody,” says the master, as he reiterates the Jain principle of kshama, forgiveness. Kshamavani is an annual Jain festival during which followers of Jain traditions publicly ask for forgiveness of everyone.To stay safe during the current pandemic, Gyansagarji says that we must stay indoors, wash our hands frequently with soap and water and make sure we keep them clean.“We should ensure that we eat healthy saatvik food,” he adds.Anita Didi emphasises the importance of purity in Jain dharma, particularly when it comes to matters of hygiene. “Leaving your footwear outside before entering the home, washing hands and feet several times a day, especially before meals — these are all personal habits encouraged in all Jain households. These traditional practices only enhance the quality of life and now, their relevance is being greatly felt by all.”Gyansagarji says that to overcome our bad karma, it is vital to have Atma jnana, knowledge of the soul. The body is just like a mobile phone; without the battery, the phone can’t work.If karma is central to the existence of every being, then what about the karma of the coronavirus — isn’t it accumulating a lot of bad karma? “Coronavirus is only a nimmitta, medium, through which we have to account for our bad karma. We have to use our viveka, intelligence, and make sure that we perform actions without ego or sense of doership. Remember Mahavira’s teaching — live and let live.” ■",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus
94,"Corona Is Here, But Where Is Karuna?","The grave crisis that has developed worldwide due to the spread of a tiny, invisible virus, reminds me of the samudra manthan story, the mythological churning of the milky ocean. Continuous churning went on for centuries, in which devas and asuras, both participated in the hope that great gifts would emerge. Instead, suddenly, a dark and deadly poison, the garala, emerged and spread worldwide. Devas and asuras fled in terror, and it was only when Shiva, Karunavataram, the incarnation of compassion, collected the poison in his hands and swallowed it, thus containing it in his own throat which turned blue (hence his name Neelkanth) that the churning continued and great gifts began to appear.



If we consider the violent churning that the human race has indulged in over the last few centuries – the ruthless exploitation of nature, the cruel destruction of millions of plant, insect and animal species, pollution of air, earth and oceans, the unsustainable high protein diets and consumption of strange animals and reptiles has, at last, thrown up a new garala that threatens the very existence of the human race.



Perhaps this is nature’s way of telling us to slowdown worldwide for a while so as to enable her to regenerate, which she seems to be doing rapidly, during the human lockdown period.To expect Shiva to appear once again and contain this poison is, to say the least, unrealistic; nonetheless, we urgently need the compassion he embodied so that together, we can meet this challenge. This must extend not only to victims of the virus but to those millions whose lives have been uprooted in the process. The sight of lakhs of migrant workers desperately trying to walk hundreds of kilometers to get back to their villages was heartrending. Have we seen a countervailing upsurge of compassion? Shakespeare’s immortal words in the Merchant of Venice are apt: “The quality of mercy is not strained/ It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven / Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest / It blesses him that gives and him that takes.”That is the karuna we need. The present crisis has taught us that firstly, despite attempts by several world leaders, notably President Trump, to trash globalization, the fact remains that in any major worldwide crisis we will all sink or swim together. The ancient Indic ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam remains valid.Secondly, it shows that our basic health infrastructure remains woefully inadequate. ‘Sharir madhyam khalu dharma sadhanam’ -- the body alone is the foundation for all dharmas. Unless we triple the percentage of GDP that is at present allotted to health and education, we will never be able to safeguard the welfare of the weaker and most vulnerable sections of society. A restructuring of our national priorities is long overdue.Thirdly, this crisis has given us the opportunity to stay home, look within and develop our intellectual and spiritual capacities, regardless of which religion we may belong to. We have to find within ourselves, springs of compassion –karuna – that alone will be able to confront this deadly corona challenge. We do not need large congregations; just quiet prayer and meditation are much more effective. As the Upanishad says, “Within the furthest golden sheath resides the immortal Brahmn. That, effulgent, light of lights, that is what the knowers of the Atman know.”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus
95,Take This Quiz And See How You Fare,"

Humanity is taking a Common Re-entrance Test (CET) with the entire country in a lockdown. The coronavirus pandemic is testing us as persons — personally and professionally. Personal test refers to management of our thoughts, body and spirit. Professional test relates to dilemmas we face at work in any sector, whether government, private or self-employed. How we react or respond to the pandemic stems from who we were, before the pandemic struck.



This invisible virus attack has taken everyone aback. No one imagined that we would need to practise physical distancing -- being termed ‘social’ distancing -- and live in fear of the person next to us. Someone you may have hugged, shook hands with, shared a meal with or even prayed with, is now to be avoided in proximity.



Personal domain: Try to answer honestly, the following questions:



Are you in control or in panic? Are you scaring people? Are you off-loading your stress on others? Are you securing things for your basic needs or are you hoarding? Are you being helpful or inaccessible? Are you sleeping well? Are you looking at the time on your hands now as a rare opportunity or are you wasting it, sulking? Are you willing to learn something new or you think it is too late?



Are you bonding with family and friends? Are you comfortable in your own company? Are you watching what you eat and drink? Do you have a fitness routine? Are you doing what you always wanted to do or are you waiting impatiently for the lockdown to end? Are you choosing your news sources for information or are you bingeing on doomsday predictions, sensationalism and rumours? Are you expressing gratitude for what you have or are you waiting to settle scores? Are you a source of joy and help in the home or are you a pain? Do you share household chores? And more...Professional domain: Are you in command and control of your own responsibility or are you looking for an opportunity to pass the buck to someone else and absolve yourself of all responsibility? Are you staying well informed so that even by a minor intervention, things may get better?Are you audio or net-connected to colleagues or are you unavailable? Are you finding fault or working out corrective measures? Are you appreciative when something went right? Are you looking out for areas of strengthening the system once normalcy returns? And more..



We live in extraordinary times of unforeseen dimensions, where we have to first protect our own physical space before we protect others. We are surrounded by ‘an invisible enemy’ with power to invade even our tiny ‘space’ at any time, whoever we may be. With neither vaccines nor cures, we need to take all precautions possible to avoid infection; hence the need to conform with recommended guidelines on prevention...



We need to also take care of our mental health, keeping ourselves constructively occupied, staying calm, perhaps with the help of spiritual practices like meditation. Good reading and good listening.



It’s both an external and internal challenge. The world will never be the same once we emerge from the current crisis. We need to reset our priorities and lifestyles. As is being pointed out, ‘Planet Earth is closed for repairs.’



The same is true for us human beings as well.

96,Protect Yourself From The Fear Contagion,"

In the housing society where I live, fear as well as common sense, are prompting most residents to stay indoors, but in the process, they inevitably consume more and more doomsday scenarios being telecast 24X7 that tend to aggravate, rather than assuage the fear factor. This can lead to terrible mental agony for those who are neither strong nor confident enough to stay unruffled.



JacebDebiec who teaches psychiatry at the University of Michigan, USA says, “There’s a pandemic of fear unfolding alongside the pandemic of the coronavirus…. Watching or hearing someone else who’s scared causes you to be frightened, too, without necessarily even knowing what caused the other person’s fear.”



Not all fear is bad; because of fear we safeguard ourselves from many dangers and risks. “Fear contagion can serve a valuable survival function,” points out Debiec. “The reaction to perceived danger is fright, freeze, flight or fight. We human beings share these automatic, unconscious behaviours with other animal species.”



The problem is of paranoia. “Robust social transmission of fear” has become ubiquitous despite our claim to being more intelligent than other species.



Fear of death tends to cloud rational thinking. Fear of hunger and poverty is very real for daily wagers. Which is why tens of thousands of poor migrant labour has sought to flee, to reach their homes, to be with family. They had no idea where their next meal would come from and what they would do without work. If only their fears had been addressed in time, and they were assured of food and shelter, they may have stayed put. Assuaging fear in times of crisis is vital; otherwise, the consequences can be fatal.For those of us who have the privilege of not having to stress about the next meal, fear-based on facts and the growing numbers of virus victims may prompt us to take preventive action, but fear itself ought not to become another, more dangerous contagion that might make us even more vulnerable. One of my neighbours refuses to step out onto her balcony for fear of getting infected. She spends her entire day wiping down door-knobs and latches, light switches and table tops, scrubbing and dusting and so on, with the result that she is a quivering bundle of jangled nerves, jumpy and terrified, though her home is now squeaky clean. Her family members walk around the house with trepidation, treading on eggshells as it were, for fear of alarming the lady who is utterly stressed out. I hear she is now learning to meditate, chant and even sing, with the help of specific Apps. All of these seem to be having a positive effect.The rest of us are simply hunkering down, working from home, following recommended protocols, waiting for the virus crisis to pass on. Blue skies, clean air, birdsong – the change is unimaginable in so short a time, with commuting suspended and factories shut, except that one cannot ignore the tragedy of so many succumbing to the disease globally, and others losing their livelihoods.It is more important to transmit useful information about safety, security and arrangements for basic needs to be met, rather than repeatedly sound alarm bells about the virus. Only then, more people will calm down and also begin the process of containing the fear virus as well.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus

In 2016, he was second only to Virat Kohli with 848 runs in 17 innings. He missed the 2018 edition, serving a suspension over his role in the ball-tampering episode during Australia’s tour of South Africa.

Overall, he is the all-time highest run-getter among overseas players. Only Kohli, Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma are above Warner in the IPL list. Warner though has been way more consistent. The three Indian batsmen have played at least 50 games more than him. Warner’s 4,706 runs have come in 126 games; Kohli has played 177 (5,412 runs), Rohit 189 (4,902) and Raina 193 (5,368).

Whatever his form leading up to IPL, Warner is a different player when he dons the Sunrisers jersey. This time he is coming off a lean spell with Australia in the limited overs series against England. Jofra Archer gave him a tough time, removing him four out of five times in the T20s and ODIs.

The two will face off again when SRH play Rajasthan Royals. Touching down in Dubai, Warner dismissed talk of Archer having his number. “As I always say, the faster you bowl the further you go,” Warner said at the end of his reply to a question on how he planned to counter Archer in the tournament.

“At the end of the day, they are going to get you out, doesn’t matter if they have your measure or not. He bowled three good balls to me, I can’t do anything about that just like Stuart Broad bowled about eight good balls at me (in the Ashes). When two (good) guys are at their peak at that moment, it’s very difficult to unsettle that, but in the last game I batted pretty well against Archer so there is nothing to worry about,” said the SRH captain.

The SRH love affair began in 2014, the first time IPL was held in the UAE—only the second half was played in India due to general elections. He was the fourth highest scorer with 528 runs. During this lockdown, Warner gained popularity in India for his social media posts dancing with family members to hit Tollywood (Telugu films) and Bollywood numbers. It started due to “pure boredom”, he said. “I know a lot about Bollywood and Tollywood, I kind of have my own stuff.”

“My five-year-old daughter had seen something months and months before I started, and she made me start dancing to the Bollywood and Tollywood songs. Then we decided to pick some dances from some famous scenes. It was just entertaining, I liked it and other people enjoyed it. It was good fun,” Warner said.

BIO BUBBLE

For Australia and England players, it’s moving from one bio-bubble to another, which has become the lot of athletes in this pandemic. The SRH captain said: “The next 12 months are going to be difficult for people, lot of challenges on that front. You need something that reminds you of home, of why you are there, and you need a very good bond with your teammates; that’s what is important in this bio-bubble.”

Some players will manage, but some may struggle. For those who struggle, it is important to raise an alarm, said Warner. “There are going to be challenges going from bubble to bubble. Mental health will be important. We all have to be smart and put our hands up if we feel things are getting challenging and we need a bit of time out.”

Built partly as entertainment, it will be a strange IPL with stands empty. For India and Australia players, a series Down Under will follow IPL. Warner hopes fans will be part of that experience. “It is great for world cricket that we can play in Australia; hopefully there is going to be some crowd as well because there have been crowds at football games. I think if 25 per cent of the capacity can go and watch it will be awesome, it is going to be a great battle between two competitive teams.”",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket
102,IPL 2020: Jos Buttler to miss Rajasthan Royals’ opening game against Chennai Super Kings due to quarantine requirement,"cricket

Updated: Sep 20, 2020 20:11 IST

England star batsman Jos Buttler announced on Sunday that he will not be a part of Rajasthan Royals’ opening game of the 13th edition of Indian Premier League against Chennai Super Kings which takes place on Tuesday. Buttler, who arrived in Dubai, UAE, along with his family, is required to spend time in a mandatory quarantine period.

“I’m unfortunately going to miss the first match for Rajasthan because I’m going to be doing my quarantine period because I’m here with my family - which is great that the Royals have allowed me to have my family out here,” Buttler informed fans in an Instagram live uploaded on the official Royals’ handle.

“It’ll be a huge help in lockdown having my family here with me,” the England cricketer further added.

Around 21 players from England and Australia reached Dubai earlier this week after completing the limited-overs series in the UK, which concluded on September 16th. The players were required to spend 36 hours in quarantine as per the BCCI guidelines, instead of the six days, because they were already placed in a bio-secure environment in the UK.

All the players arrived on a chartered flight in the UAE. But Buttler is required to spend an entire period of six days in quarantine because he came on a different flight with his family.

Buttler is an important player for Royals. Compatriots Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes are also part of the team. Star all-rounder Stokes’ participation in the tournament is also in doubt as he is spending his time with his ailing father in New Zealand. He is expected to miss a few games at least in the first half of the tournament.

Updated: Sep 20, 2020 18:28 IST

Sunrisers Hyderabad bowler Rashid Khan on Sunday said that even though Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli is one of the best players in the world, it is not excusable to bowl a bad delivery to him. Rashid’s remarks came at the virtual press conference just a day before SRH’s first IPL game of the season against RCB which takes place on Monday.

On being asked about the challenges faced by the bowlers in IPL, Rashid Khan said: “IPL is a different league (compared to CPL), different pressure. Playing against big names like Kohli and others is a big challenge.

“No doubt he (Kohli) is one of the best players in the world and you have to have the best ball for him, there is no excuse to bowl a bad delivery,” he added.

On being asked about what are his plans to face off against Kohli, the Afghanistan spinner said: “He’ll be back in the field after a long break, let’s see what his reaction is, how he performs.”

With 55 wickets in three seasons, Rashid Khan is one of the lethal bowlers operating in the IPL but the Afghanistan spinner says his focus is not on taking wickets but bowling economically. He enjoys the best bowling economy of 6.55 at an average of 21.69 in the IPL. The batsmen have now started playing out his overs to avoid the risk of losing their wickets.

“My focus is always bowling economically well for the team. When I bowl economically it helps the bowlers on the other end to take wickets,” Rashid said.

“I concentrate on bowling dot balls and putting pressure on the batsman so he can take risks. My focus is the team’s requirement, what helps the team is important to me. I have 4-5 grips. I bowl them according to the wicket based on the reaction of the wicket. Those five grips help me to bowl differently as each one pitches differently.

“I keep mixing it up. I have those varieties and I need to use them well. I use my fingers and shoulders a lot to generate the pace,” he signed off.

104,These 7 period hacks will ensure you never stain your clothes ever again,"Published on:20 September 2020, 14:00pm IST

If you are tired of stained clothes and sheets, it’s time to put your faith in these period hacks that ensure your mensuration time is mess-free.

We all have different struggles when it comes to our periods. While some experience cramps and heavy flow, others have mood swings. Then there are a few unfortunate folks who suffer from it all. But if there is one suffering that is common for all women everywhere, then it has to be staining.

We know what a task it is to always have to check your clothes after getting up from somewhere or waking up to a stained bed-sheet. Don’t even get us started on how hard it is to get period stains off of clothes. So, to help you avoid them unfortunate stains, here are seven period hacks:

Get Your Daily Dose Of Wellness Subscribe to our Newsletter

1. Overnight pads

Overnight pads absorb more blood than regular pads. So, using them might help you prevent leaks. While one should suffice for an entire night, it all depends upon your flow. If you experience very heavy flow, you can try placing an extra pad in the back or front of your underwear, depending on what position you sleep in. Remember the longer the pad, the better.

2. Switch to tampons or menstrual cups

Super absorbent tampons are a great solution to your staining problem, provided you don’t sleep for over eight hours. If you do, then you put yourself at risk of toxic shock syndrome.

Alternatively, you can use menstrual cups instead which can be worn for 12 hours.

3. Wear two panties

If you use pads then you know the struggle of your pad moving left and right while sleeping. Wearing two panties can ensure that the pad is placed right and tight, and doesn’t move from its position while you are sleeping.

And in case there is a leak, the additional fabric adds the extra barrier before the blood reaches your sheets. If you aren’t comfortable wearing two panties, a pair of tight sleep shorts should also do the trick.

4. Period undies

Period panties are specifically designed to absorb blood, much like a built-in pad in your underwear. You can wear these panties as a backup, so that even if there is a leak, the underwear can absorb it.

5. Period sheets

We all have sheets that we aren’t very fond of for some reason. Once you know that your period is coming up, bring these sheets out and make them for “period sheets”. So even if you ruin then, there will be no love lost. Preferably choose dark sheets so that washing off the stain is easier.

Also, listen:

6. Change your pad/tampon before going to sleep

Put on a fresh pad or insert a new tampon before you go to bed. If you are using a tampon or a menstrual cup and are unsure of your sleep timings, switch to a pad right before you sleep to reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome.

7. Sleep in a comfortable position

It is important that you are comfortable at night for two reasons: 1. It helps you fall asleep faster. 2. It prevents you from changing your position again and again. There is no right or wrong position as long as you are comfortable. Less movement will ensure that your pad is in the right place thus avoiding any kind of leakage.",https://www.hindustantimes.com

106,Making these 5 mistakes while doing tabletop crunches can reduce your chances of a flat belly,"Published on:20 September 2020, 12:00pm IST

Just doing tabletop crunches for the heck of it isn't going to give you a flat belly. You need to do them the right way and avoid these mistakes.

Working those abs might look tedious, but that could be because you are not doing it right. Relying too much on Google and not-very-knowledgeable gym patrons is one of the main reasons why we don’t get the desired results, despite slogging it out. In the case of tabletop crunches, this is a very big possibility.

Tabletop crunches are fairly simple. You just need to lie on your back on the floor, lift your legs up and bend them from your knees at a right angle, and do the crunches by lifting your upper body. But a few nuances make all the difference. That’s why we want you to ace this exercise so that you can get rid of that belly fat in no time.

Get Your Daily Dose Of Wellness Subscribe to our Newsletter

Presenting, five rookie mistakes that you might be making while doing tabletop abs crunch:

1. Not lifting your legs properly

If you are not lifting your legs properly then there is no point of doing this abs crunch. You need to ensure that your legs have a proper stance so that you hit the right muscle and burn some fat. Between your thighs and upper body there should be a 90 degree angle and after bending your knees, your lower leg should be parallel to the ground.

Also, you need to hold this stance until you finish your entire set. Taking a break will release all the tension in the muscles and then it won’t be that effective.

2. Not breathing properly

If you are not breathing properly then you are not burning enough calories. Do you know, if you breathe properly while doing an exercise then you can increase its impact many times? So, ensure that while lifting up your body, you exhale and while going down you inhale. Also, keep your core tight.

3. You are not holding your crunch

To lose that fat around your belly it is important to increase the impact of the exercise. How can you do that? Well, by holding the actual position for a few seconds. When you hold the pose, more calories are used to keep that stance up and to balance your entire body. The result? Double the weight loss.

4. You are not supporting your neck and back

According to fitness expert, Ruchika Rai, not supporting your back and neck while doing crunches can cost you big time. “This can lead to severe pain in your neck and lower back, and also lead to sprains,” she says.

That’s why whenever you perform tabletop abs crunches please ensure that you do it on a proper mat. Also, lock the fingers of your hand and put them behind your neck for better support.

Also, watch:

5. You’re doing them too fast

Slower the better. This is the fitness funda you must memorize if you want every exercise to give you foolproof results. The logic is very simple: the slower you move, the more muscles you’ll contract and more weight you’ll lose. Also, you will reduce your risk of injuries.

So, there you go. Now that you know how to do tabletop crunches the right way, so ahead and practice them to get a flat belly.",https://www.hindustantimes.com
107,Anushka Sharma swears by the ancient Ayurveda practice of oil pulling. Here’s why you should too,"Published on:20 September 2020, 11:00am IST

Celebrities all over the world, including Bollywood beauty Anushka Sharma, can’t do without the age-old Ayurvedic practice of oil pulling. Here’s why

Listen to this article

Coconut oil has made its way into the beauty routines of several celebrities, be it in Bollywood or Hollywood. They just can’t stop raving about its benefits—after all, you can use it to moisturise dry skin, tame frizzy hair, or smoothen flaky lips. But did you know this miracle oil can also be used for oil pulling? Yes, we learnt this from B-town beauty, Anushka Sharma.

In an Instagram post, Sharma posted a picture of herself oil pulling, and asked her fans to follow this practice for its various benefits! “This action is excellent for dental hygiene & health and also draws out toxins in the body. As we are all using this time to take better care of our health and improve our immunity I thought of sharing this,” said her post.

What is oil pulling?

This age-old Ayurvedic technique involves swishing oil in your mouth to remove bacteria and promote dental hygiene. It’s super simple—all you need to do is swish coconut oil in your mouth for about 20 minutes, and then spit it out. According to a study by PubMed, there are over 700 types of bacteria that can live in your mouth, and at least 350 are active at any given point!

The oil removes fat-soluble toxins from the body and destroys bacteria. What’s more, it also helps to strengthen gums, removes plaque, and lowers the formation of cavities.

Another Bollywood actress who is a strong proponent of oil pulling, is none other than Shilpa Shetty Kundra. In an interview with Vogue, she shared: “I do oil pulling for 7-10 minutes using cold-pressed coconut oil.”

Experts suggest it is best to do oil pulling first thing in the morning, even before drinking a glass of water.

What are the benefits of oil pulling?

1. Improves oral hygiene

While oil pulling is not an alternative to brushing or flossing, it is a great way to enhance your dental hygiene. As per a study by Faizal Peedikayil, Prathima Sreenivasan and Arun Narayanan, titled ‘Effect of coconut oil in plaque related gingivitis’, oil pulling using coconut oil led to a significant decrease in plaque, after practicing this ritual for a week.

However, coconut oil can not whiten teeth or even solve other tooth-related issues.

2. Benefits digestion and gut health

Health experts say that the build-up of bacteria and germs in your mouth can trigger inflammation in the body, and that’s not a good sign at all. With oil pulling, you can keep infections at bay from the very start!

“The healthy fats in the oil leads to less production of the acid in the stomach, which helps to improve your digestion and maintain better gut health,” says Tanya Mehrotra, an NCR-based wellness consultant.

3. Helps to reduce migraines

Coconut oil is known to reduce inflammation, and that’s exactly why it is great for cardiac health and brain function. Oil pulling creates warmth inside your mouth, which can help to tackle sinuses, and that means fewer headaches!

This is confirmed by a study titled ‘Oil pulling and importance of traditional medicine in oral health maintenance’, which says that oil swishing is believed to cure or control 30 different types of systemic diseases, including headaches, migraine, and chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes mellitus.

So ladies, oil pulling every day keeps several problems at bay! Do try and tell us how helpful you find it in the comments. We are waiting!",https://www.hindustantimes.com

109,IPL 2020: Why some teams could be banking more on foreign players initially in IPL13,"cricket

Updated: Sep 20, 2020 13:20 IST

Last Wednesday, Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises had more than a passing interest in the action at Manchester where England and Australia were involved in an intense one-dayer. Soon most of these players would be part of the IPL, which began in UAE on Saturday, and they included some top names such as Pat Cummins, Eoin Morgan, David Warner and Jonny Bairstow.

The England-Australia limited overs series not only benefited their cricket boards in the time Covid-19 but also IPL teams. There’s no gainsaying that match-fitness from the series would have helped these stars to tune up for the high-pressure T20 event.

“Every time, IPL has happened at the end of the season; first time it is acting as a curtain-raiser for the (India) season. Earlier, our focus used to be on trying and giving rest to the players who were coming after a long season. This time, the teams have been left looking to give them game time. It could be a tournament where the teams’ start slowly but finish strongly,” says former assistant-coach of Delhi Capitals Pravin Amre, now a talent scout with Mumbai Indians.

Rajasthan Royals (RR) are one of the sides to benefit from the England-Australia series, having four players joining them: Steve Smith, Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer and Tom Curran. “It’s good to see them returning with some valuable cricket behind them. As we all saw, it was a highly competitive, well-contested series between two wonderful sides which would’ve definitely upped their cricketing focus and would have re-invigorated their big-game instinct,” said RR head coach Andrew McDonald.

Smith is RR captain and with Buttler and Archer forms the team’s nucleus. “All those players are a vital cog of our Rajasthan Royals wheel and having them in this shape is key. Not only will their cricketing prowess help the squad but also their experience of competitive cricket in this post-COVID new-normal will be helpful in pushing the team in the right direction as we look to play cricket in these unusual circumstances,” said McDonald.

“They have been in a bio-bubble world as well (so it) won’t be such a shock to their system coming into the bubble,” said John Gloster, head of RR’s strength and conditioning team.

Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) coach Anil Kumble too would be pleased as when we talk of IPL in UAE, Glenn Maxwell is the first name that springs to mind. In KXIP colours, Maxwell led the team to five wins out of five when a part of the tournament was held here in 2014. In his first three matches then, Maxwell aggregated 279 runs (95 off 43 balls; 89 off 45 balls, 95 off 43 balls) at a mind-boggling average of 93. He served another warning on Wednesday with 90-ball 108, the second century of his ODI career.

The situation in which he played that knock and the quality of strokeplay meant Maxwell, who took a break to deal with mental health issues, is back to his best. In typical style, he smoked more sixes than fours, raising his hundred with his seventh over-boundary. The stage is set for Maxwell again.

No franchise is as reliant on one overseas player as Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are on Warner. The Australian had a quiet series in England but it was possibly because of his inability to deal with the conditions, which was evident during the last Ashes too. Warner has a great record in IPL and had settled down in the final ODI before frittering a good start with a poor shot against Joe Root’s part-time off-spin. As SRH captain, he will be happy with the form shown by Bairstow, the England opener smashing a hundred in the final ODI. The Warner-Bairstow firm was the most successful opening pair last season with 791 runs.

Warner’s teammate Mitchell Marsh is also part of SRH. Australia captain Aaron Finch and leg-spinner Adam Zampa are with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) who also have England’s Moen Ali. England’s Sam Curran and Australia’s Josh Hazlewood play for Chennai Super Kings; Australia keeper-batsman Alex Carey, who got a match-winning hundred on Wednesday, is with Delhi Capitals; Cummins, the biggest buy of the last auction, and Eoin Morgan will represent Kolkata Knight Riders.

Royals should also be happy with Jos Buttler’s form. He didn’t get runs in the one-day series but was the best player in the twenty20 matches preceding the ODIs.

Some players from West Indies and Afghanistan have tuned in by taking part in the Caribbean Premier League. They are: SRH’s spin duo of Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi; Mumbai Indians’ Kieron Pollard; CSK’s Dwayne Bravo; KKR’s Sunil Narine and Andre Russell and DC’s Shimron Hetmyer (DC).

Over the course of IPL13, Indian players will be central to these teams’ plans but for the early part, they could bank a little more on their foreign players.

“Even though we say the players are all mature, they need a game or two to shake off rust. The Australia and England players will be match ready. Those players will be in rhythm. To find the rhythm is so critical. The batsmen adjust faster, the bowlers take a little more time,” said Amre.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket

While Kia Sonet's launch a few days ago has promised to add mighty zing to an already lucrative segment, the Urban Cruiser too is looking at putting up a stiff fight.

The sub-compact SUV segment is not just lucrative but is hotly contested as well. Dominated by Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza before Hyundai Venue decided to take the lead, it also features Mahindra XUV300 and Tata Nexon. But the established players are facing a lot of heat from newer rivals and the likes of Sonet, Urban Cruiser and even Nissan Magnite - scheduled for an early 2021 launch - promise to offer a showroom full of options.

The fate of and reception to the Urban Cruiser would be extremely interesting because while the vehicle is essentially a rebadged version of Brezza, it promises have its own unique elements. This is largely thanks to a bold dynamic grille, LED projector headlamp, LED fog lamps on the outside. The cabin will feature a smart playcast touchscreen, and dual-tone premium interiors.

Additionally, features like diamond cut 16-inch alloy wheels, rain sensing wipers, automatic climate control (standard across all variants), cruise control and electrochromic rear view mirror are also present to help Urban Cruiser find its intended mark in the market.

Urban Cruiser sub-compact SUV will be Toyota's second spin-off of a Maruti car, the first one being the Baleno hatchback which is sold as the Glanza in the Indian market. While Toyota has enjoyed a whole lot of success with its bigger cars like Fortuner and Innova Crysta in the Indian market, the company's foray into smaller segments have been a hit and miss.

111,Elon Musk’s showy events gin up hype Tesla doesn’t always live up to,"The last time Elon Musk held a Tesla Inc. briefing similar to the battery day event he’ll host this week, he boasted about his track record of following through on big promises.

“All these things, I said we would do them, we did it,"" Musk said during Tesla’s April 2019 autonomy day. “Only criticism—and it’s a fair one—is sometimes I’m not on time. But I get it done and the Tesla team gets it done.""

The chief executive officer was right in some respects and candid in nodding to the times it took Tesla longer than he predicted to bring things to market. What he didn’t acknowledge was that several products he’s hyped at events that have burnished his Silicon Valley-visionary image were barely commercialized, still aren’t available or were abandoned entirely.

Musk, 49, won’t be selling investors a bill of goods on Tuesday—batteries are core to the existing products and technology that have made Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world. But the tendency to overpromise has contributed to the billionaire having become such a divisive figure with many doubters still left to prove wrong.

Here’s a look back at what Musk has promoted at live events over the years:

Model X — February 2012

A Tesla Model X electric vehicle (REUTERS)

Tesla was less than 20 months removed from its initial public offering and hadn’t delivered its first Model S sedans when Musk unveiled a prototype of the Model X, which he said would go into production in late 2013.

The crossover SUV arrived almost a full two years late, with the first customers getting them in September 2015. The first thing he called attention to at the Model X unveiling—its double-hinged “falcon wing"" doors—later slowed the SUV’s rollout, and Musk would later blame disappointing deliveries on the “hubris"" of trying to do too much with the vehicle.

Musk claimed during the unveiling that the doors didn’t go any higher than a normal SUV’s rear hatchback, but some customers opened them into the ceiling of their garage. The Model X has consistently scored poorly in Consumer Reports rankings while Tesla’s other vehicles have scored well.

Battery Swap — June 2013

This was one of Musk’s more problematic presentations because the product offering never really came to pass.

Model S drivers would have the choice of replenishing their batteries at Tesla superchargers that would always be free, Musk said, or drive to stations featuring the same sort of automated equipment used in the company’s factory that would swap out one pack for another. He demonstrated this could take place in less time than it takes to fill a gas tank.

Tesla later started charging for supercharger use, and Musk said there ended up being little customer interest in battery-pack swaps. California’s Air Resources Board for a time awarded Teslas extra zero-emission vehicle credits based on the company’s plan to offer battery swaps, but tweaked its rules less than a year after Musk’s demonstration.

Dual Motor, Autopilot — October 2014

Must sent out a cryptic tweet days before his appearance: “About time to unveil the D and something else."" The D stood for a dual motor version of the Model S, and the something else was Autopilot, which turned out to be anything but an afterthought for Tesla.

The CEO announced that all cars produced in the two weeks leading up to the event had been built with radar, image-recognition cameras and ultrasonic sonar installed. “The car can do almost anything,"" Musk said, listing features such as lane keeping, automatic cruise control and self-parking, and the ability for owners to summon their vehicle in a parking lot. Claims that Autopilot would one day render Teslas fully capable of driving themselves didn’t come until later.

Tesla ended up going through an ugly breakup with Mobileye, a key supplier of early Autopilot harware, in 2016. After debuting its Summon feature in 2019, some owners posted footage showing their cars getting into scrapes with other vehicles or narrowly avoiding accidents. Consumer Reports called it “glitchy.""

Tesla Energy — May 2015

Musk laid out a vision for harnessing the sun—or as he colorfully put it, “this handy fusion reactor in the sky""—by not only collecting energy from solar panels but also storing it in batteries for the home.

“Now, the issue with existing batteries is that they suck,"" he said, calling them expensive, unreliable, stinky, ugly and “bad in every way."" The missing piece, Tesla’s $3,500 Powerwall, “looks like a beautiful sculpture on the wall,"" he said. Customers wouldn’t have to worry about running out of power and could go off the grid. The product could scale globally and be of particular use in remote parts of the world where there’s intermittent or expensive electricity.

In the five years since this event, cars have remained the dominant aspect of Tesla’s business, with 86% of revenue coming from automotive last quarter. Musk has said the business is “cell-starved,"" meaning Tesla lacks the supply of battery cells it needs to support both its cars and Powerwall.

Model 3 — March 2016

Tesla managed to follow through on a lot of the specifications Musk promised for the Model 3, including at least 215 miles of range. He drew laughs from the crowd by alluding to his propensity for missing deadlines when announcing the timing of initial deliveries: “I do feel fairly confident that it will be next year.""

The event was a smash success, with Tesla taking hundreds of thousands of deposits for its first affordable, high-volume car.

But one key promise the company failed to follow through on was a $35,000 starting price. Three years later, Musk announced plans to close most of Tesla’s stores as a cost-saving measure that would allow him to offer the car at that cost. He backtracked 10 days later. Today, the cheapest Model 3 is $37,990.

Solar Roof — October 2016

Months after proposing what he referred to as a “blindingly obvious"" and “no-brainer"" acquisition, this event helped get Tesla shareholders behind Musk’s plan to buy SolarCity Corp., the debt-saddled solar sales-and-installation business he co-founded with his cousins.

On stage, Musk held up different styles of roof tiles with solar cells that weren’t actually functional. Shareholders approved the more than $2 billion acquisition a few weeks later.

“At the time I thought it made strategic sense for Tesla and SolarCity to combine. Hindsight is 20-20,"" Musk said in a deposition 2 ½ years later. “If I could wind back the clock, you know, I would say [I] probably would have let SolarCity execute by itself.""

Semi, Roadster — December 2017

Time will tell if the Semi truck truly offers “quasi-infinite"" brake life and “thermonuclear explosion-proof"" glass, as Musk claimed. The CEO said at the time the company would start production in 2019. It’s now scheduled to begin next year.

Musk threw show-goers for a loop by unveiling surprise cargo in one of the trucks: a new Roadster prototype he said would be “the fastest production car ever made, period.""

The CEO has walked back plans to make the car available this year. In May, he listed several other tasks Tesla will need to achieve first, suggesting it may not arrive until after next year.

Model Y — March 2019

﻿

With Model 3 production finally in full swing after a bruising year in which Musk said Tesla came within weeks of running out of money, he thanked the crowd for supporting the company through a difficult period. He imitated his critics—“You’re a fraud!""—and offered a retort referring to the cars the company had delivered: “You can drive that fraud!""

To Tesla’s credit, the Model Y arrived much earlier than scheduled. Musk said at the time of this event that the crossover would start reaching customers in the fall of 2020. That timeline was accelerated to March.

Autonomy Day — April 2019

The hours-long presentation began a highly technical walk-through of Tesla’s technology with senior engineers on the Autopilot team. Then, Musk started making his usual bold predictions.

“We expect to have the first operating robotaxis next year,"" he said. “With no one in them. Next year."" Any customer would be able to add their car to Tesla Network, a service Musk described as a combination of Uber and Airbnb. Model 3 owners would be able to share their car whenever they wanted and make money on people taking it for a drive. Tesla would take a 25% to 30% cut of the revenue. Within roughly two years, Musk predicted, the company would stop building its cars with steering wheels or pedals.

None of this has come to pass yet. The CEO also said that by the middle of 2020, Tesla would have more than 1 million cars on the road with hardware capable of full self-driving and features completed to where vehicle occupants wouldn’t need to pay attention. Today, the company still warns Autopilot users they have to keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

Cybertruck — November 2019

It took a matter of minutes for the prototype of Tesla’s first pickup to fall short of expectations in an over-the-top event featuring a hologram “cybergirl,"" sledgehammers and balls of flame shot into the air.

A demonstration of how tough the truck’s stainless steel “exoskeleton"" went well, with the doors sustaining several blows without denting. But an attempt to show off the strength of its transparent-metal “armor"" glass went disastrously—a metal ball shattered both the first- and second-row windows.

“Eh, not bad,"" Musk said after the stunt gone awry. “Room for improvement.""

112,India moves a step closer to bring in vehicle scrappage policy,"The government on Saturday said a Cabinet note has been formulated for the vehicle scrapping policy.

""Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has formulated a note for Cabinet on creation of an ecosystem for voluntary and environment friendly phasing out of unfit and old polluting vehicles,"" Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways VK Singh told Rajya Sabha in reply to a query.

The proposed policy, once approved, will be applicable on all vehicles, the government had said earlier.

The policy was sent for a fresh round of consultation with stakeholders on the direction of the PMO.

Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadakri had earlier this year said once the policy is approved, India could emerge as a hub for automobile manufacturing as key raw material available from scrapping steel, aluminium and plastic are bound to be recycled, bringing down automobile prices by ""20-30 per cent"".

Vehicle scrappage policy in India may also allow scrap cars from abroad.

On July 26, 2019, the government had proposed amendments to motor vehicle rules to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.

114,TikTok-Oracle deal: Here’s everything you need to know about it,"It has been a busy couple of weeks for ByteDance. Over the past couple of weeks, the company that owns the popular short-video sharing app TikTok has been busy negotiating a deal that would salvage its business in the US and enable its users in the country to continue using the platform.

ByteDance, ever since the US President imposed sweeping bans on US transactions on the company, has been working feverishly in carving out a deal that would allow the China-based company to hold a minority stake in TikTok’s US business while addressing the concerns raised by the Trump administration over the app posing a security threat to the US people.

It held negotiations with Microsoft, whose bid it later rejected. “ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft...We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users while protecting national security interests,” Microsoft said in a statement shortly after ByteDance rejected its proposal.

ByteDance also held negotiations with Oracle, which eventually helped the company to close a deal before the deadline for the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration came into effect, that is, September 20.

""I have given the deal my blessing...I approve the deal in concept,"" President Trump said as he gave his approval to the historic deal. The deal, however, is yet to get approval by authorities in China, where ByteDance is based.

TikTok-Oracle deal

TikTok, on Thursday, announced that it was partnering with Oracle and Walmart in order to address the concerns raised by the US authorities and make the platform available to the users in the country. As a part of the deal, TikTok will become TikTok Global, a technology company that is based in the US. Oracle will be TikTok Global’s trusted technology partner. It will also be responsible for hosting the company’s US data and securing all the associated computer systems such that it addresses all the concerns raised by the local authorities.

ByteDance is also working on a deal with Walmart over a commercial partnership. Both the companies, that is Oracle and Walmart, in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round wherein the two companies combined will be able to acquire a 20% cumulative stake in the company. Existing ByteDance investors such as Sequoia Capital, General Altantic and Coatue Capital will also be able to participate in the pre-IPO financing round.

Additionally, TikTok Global will set up a headquarter in the US and bring nearly 25,000 jobs across the country.

While announcing the deal, TikTok’s Interim head Vanessa Pappas penned a note wherein she informed the users that the popular video-sharing platform wasn’t going anywhere. She also thanked the users for their support. “We want to thank all of the members of our community who have shown tremendous support...TikTok is what it is because of all of you...This is just the beginning for TikTok, and we're so excited to be with you in this journey for the long run,” she wrote in a blog post.",https://www.hindustantimes.com
115,Here’s what TikTok said after Donald Trump gave his blessings for Oracle deal,"US President Donald Trump on Saturday gave his blessings to the TikTok-Oracle deal, which enables the company to continue offering its services in the US. Shortly after, TikTok shared a message with its users in the US wherein it reiterated that it wasn’t going anywhere.

“We are humbled and grateful for your continued support! And we are excited to confirm that we aren’t going anywhere!,” TikTok wrote in a message on Twitter.

Apart from sharing a message on Twitter, TikTok’s Interim Head Venessa Pappas wrote a detailed blog post explaining what the deal with Oracle entailed. “We're pleased that today we've confirmed a proposal that resolves the Administration's security concerns and settles questions around TikTok's future in the US,” Pappas wrote in a blog post.

As a part of the deal, TikTok will create a new company based in the US called TikTok Global. Oracle will be the company’s trusted cloud and technology provider and it will ensure the security of TikTok’s users' in the US. Pappas also said that both Oracle and Walmart will take part in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round in which they can take up to a 20% cumulative stake in the company.

In addition to this, the new entity called TikTok Global would set up a new headquarter in the US and bring “25,000 jobs across the country.”

Pappas, apart from informing users about the change, also thanked TikTok users for their support. “We want to thank all of the members of our community who have shown tremendous support – to us, but more importantly, for each other – throughout this period of turbulence. TikTok is what it is because of all of you,” she added.",https://www.hindustantimes.com
116,Apple Watch SE vs Series 3: Which one should you go for?,"Apple launched a bunch of new products at its event earlier this week. It also introduced an affordable smartwatch this time called the “Apple Watch SE”. Like the iPhone SE, the Apple Watch SE also packs high-end hardware but cuts down on the premium features. Apple usually discontinues older generations of its hardware but it is still retaining the Watch Series 3.

There are two affordable Apple watches to pick from now although the Watch Series 3 is evidently cheaper. In comparison to the Apple Watch SE, you would be paying ₹10,000 less for the Watch Series 3. We compare the two smartwatches to find out what are the differences.

Design

There’s no distinct difference in design on the Apple Watch SE and Watch Series 3, and both would look quite similar to anyone. But the display is one area you would probably see a difference. The Apple Watch SE has a 30% larger display than the Watch Series 3. You’ll also notice thicker bezels on the Watch Series 3. The Watch SE also supports haptic feedback on the digital crown.

The sizes are also different with the Watch SE coming in 44mm and 40mm, and the Watch Series 3 in 42mm and 38mm. Both the Apple watches come in silver and space grey but the Watch SE has a gold variant as well. The Watch SE flaunts a ceramic and sapphire crystal back like the Watch Series 6. On the Watch Series 3 you get a composite back.

Performance

The Watch SE is powered by the S5 chip which is also used on the Watch Series 5. Apple says this chip is up to 2x faster than the S3 that powers the Series 3. The battery life is however the same on both the Watch SE and the Series 3 with up to 18 hours of juice on a single charge. The Watch SE also boasts more storage with 32GB on the GPS variant as compared to only 8GB on the Watch Series 3.

Features

The Watch SE comes with international emergency calling, fall detection and it’s equipped with a compass. It also has an always-on altimeter, and cellular connectivity. These are the key features that are missing on the Watch Series 3. Other features like GPS, water resistance, and heart rate monitoring are available on both the Apple watches.

Price

Apple currently has only the GPS model of the Watch Series 3 and this one starts at ₹20,900 in India. The Watch SE is priced at ₹29,900 for the GPS model, and ₹33,900 for the cellular model.

Summing up

Apple’s reason to continue the Series 3 is understandable since it’s still the second-most popular smartwatch globally. If you want more out of your Apple Watch then you should go for the Watch SE. You can still go for the Watch Series 3 if your budget is low since it still gets all the basics done. But you would miss out on some key features, and may face storage issues as well.",https://www.hindustantimes.com

118,"Emmy 2020: This Is Us actor Ron Cephas Jones gets award after mix-up, Jason Bateman announced winner by mistake","tv

Updated: Sep 20, 2020 17:25 IST

In a virtual Emmys version of the wrong-winner Oscars gaffe, Ron Cephas Jones’ guest actor award for This Is Us was announced for another nominee, Jason Bateman. The error occurred during Saturday’s online creative arts Emmys, precursor to Sunday’s main ceremony and the culmination of a week of events honoring technical and other achievements.

Saturday’s show on FXX, however, was the only one of the creative arts presentations to be televised, making the error more glaring. In a voice-over announcement, Bateman was declared the winner for his guest appearance on HBO’s The Outsider, while the screen displayed Jones’ name.

The confusion wasn’t addressed until after a commercial break, with an on-screen message that read, “Our apologies, an incorrect winner has been announced. We’re fixing it now,” followed by the repeated display of Jones’ name but without an announcement. There was no immediate explanation for the mistake.

Bateman has another shot Sunday, when he is competing for the best actor honors for Ozark. The ABC telecast (8 p.m. EDT) will be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

Given the virtual event’s lack of on-stage presenters and a theater audience, the error was far less dramatic than the 2017 Oscars mix-up, in which Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly announced La La Land as the best picture instead of winner Moonlight.

But the Emmys misstep represented a cautionary note for Sunday’s show, which also will be virtual because of the pandemic but has ambitious plans. More than 100 cameras are being deployed to nominees at home and elsewhere so winners can accept their award in real time.

Other winners Saturday included Eddie Murphy, whose return to Saturday Night Live after more than three decades earned the star his first Emmy Award, for guest comedy series actor. Maya Rudolph claimed the category’s guest actress trophy for her portrayal of Sen. Kamala Harris on the same episode. Cherry Jones was honored as guest actor in a drama series for Succession.

The IPL’s two most successful teams – Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings – will kickstart IPL 2020 on Saturday in Abu Dhabi. Ahead of the big-ticket clash and what is widely being termed as the ‘El Classico’ of IPL mainly because of the rich history between these two sides, former India captain and current BCCI president Sourav Ganguly was asked to name the ‘favourites.’

Ganguly did not directly name a side but agreed it will be a tight match between MI and CSK.

“It’s a bit difficult to name the favourite (for today’s match), both of them are very good teams. These two have won the IPL most number of times,” Ganguly told Bengali daily Ananda Bazar Patrika.

As far as numbers and head-to-head records are concerned the four-time champions Mumbai Indians have far better numbers than MS Dhoni’s CSK. The Rohit Sharma-led side had beaten CSK four times in last season itself. And they would be looking to start on the right note this time around too.

Reacting to the occasion of IPL being played in UAE because of the Covid situation in India, Ganguly said it will be different this year.

“Everything is fine so far. Now the wait is for cricket to begin.

“The current situation is very challenging. But challenges are there in everyone’s life. This IPL will be a lot different this year. I’ll hope everything goes well. We’ve had to prepare everything fro scratch because of Covid, have had to create a completely new system. The health and medical security will be of utmost importance,” Ganguly said.

He is someone I really admire for his fire.” Fresh from guiding Trinbago Knight Riders to their title triumph in Caribbean Premier League, McCullum will take over as the KKR coach in the 13th edition of the T20 tournament underway in the UAE.

“Whether it was his stint as the captain of the New Zealand team or his approach in the IPL clashes, I just love the way he goes about it. He really wants to put on the show and take the game on,” Cummins said.

Cummins became the most expensive foreign buy in IPL history in last year’s auction after KKR picked him for Rs 15.5 crore. The world number one Test bowler will spearhead KKR’s pace attack which will also have talented Indian youngsters like Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shivam Mavi, Prasidh Krishna and Sandeep Warrier.

Nagarkoti will return to action after a lengthy injury lay-off for two seasons and Cummins said he would tell him to “be patient”. “It is really an easy thing to say and think of but an 18-year-old missing games is actually a very hard thing to live with. You just need to have the trust that you might miss a season or two at the start of your career but you might end up playing till the age of 36 or 37, as opposed to 31 or 32,” said Cummins.

“Everything that you do during this time, sets up the foundation block for a long and healthy career. Even when I was not playing, I used to hang out with my teammates. 90% of the time I love cricket because I can hang out with my mates.” For an out-and-out pacer who can swing the new white ball, powerplay could be the ideal time for him but Cummins said he would look to bowl at any time of the match.

“The thing I love about T20 cricket is it’s ultra-attacking, or at the death, it’s ultra-defensive. There is no middle ground. So, in T20 cricket, if you are an all-out bowler, you get to bowl any time of the match. That’s why I love the format,” he signed off.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports-news
129,IPL 2020: ‘Have told Ashwin I wouldn’t want him to Mankad’,"cricket

Updated: Sep 20, 2020 18:01 IST

Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting has reiterated that he has told his off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin that he does not want him to dismiss an opposition batsman by ‘Mankading’ him. The debate over the Mankad law has been going on for over a year since Ashwin used the rule to dismiss Rajasthan Royals’ Jos Buttler in an IPL match last year. Ashwin was leading Kings XI Punjab at the time, and the moment led to widespread discussion on whether the Mankad rule is within the spirit of the game or not.

In a recent chat on InsideSport’s “Amstrad Face 2 Face Cricket Series” show, Ricky Ponting was questioned if he would want Ashwin to Mankad a batsman in the final over of the final game of the tournament with one wicket remaining. (IPL 2020 Full Coverage)

In his reply, Ponting cheekily said: “I am not going to ball Ashwin in the last over of the game.”

The fomer Australia captain went on: “We have spoken about it and I have told him my expectation that I wouldn’t want him to Mankad.”

He further explained that he does not approve of the law, and believes that the umpire should instead focus on ensuring that the batsman on the non-striker’s end is not cheating by stepping outside the crease.

“Although the Mankad is a very simple playing law in the game. It is one law I am not happy with and I am a part of the rules and law committee with the MCC. What we have to do is to stop batsmen from cheating which they tend to do in the death overs of the game.

“Umpires need to be a little cautious as well and need to get a signal in the ear from the third umpire to let the batsman know not to be cheating,” Ponting said.

Updated: Sep 20, 2020 16:27 IST

But for the pandemic, it would have been the third successive Indian Premier League (IPL) season for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) without young fast bowlers Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti. When the franchise invested Rs 6.2 crore on them in January 2018, they were teens who had exploded in the Under-19 World Cup. Since then, the journey has been so fraught with injuries that cricket, at best, was an interruption.

After a good debut at Eden Gardens where his first wicket was former KKR captain Gautam Gambhir, Mavi played eight games in 2018 and missed IPL 2019. Three seasons with KKR, Nagarkoti is yet to pull on the purple shirt because he hasn’t played competitive cricket since February 2018. That could finally change in the UAE where KKR begin on September 23 against defending champions Mumbai Indians.

“If I get a game, I will tell myself that I am realising a dream. Now I feel like I can handle anything,” says Nagarkoti. “With three-four days to go, I am at almost 100 percent,” says Mavi.

“Nagarkoti has become very strong. They are both bowling at over 140(kmph) and that is challenging for any batsmen,” says KKR batsman Nitish Rana.

In separate interviews to Hindustan Times from Abu Dhabi where KKR are based, Mavi and Nagarkoti spoke on the importance of staying positive and how the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru was a home away from home. It was at NCA that they mended stress fractures and back injuries. They are occupational hazards of being a quick; Mavi and Nagarkoti’s breakdowns possibly compounded by the fact their bodies weren’t fully mature for such rigour.

“NCA is a great place for rehab. They give you a clear schedule so you know when you have a gym session and when you need to go for a run. Also, good physios are hard to find in India but at NCA they have so many good physios that you get a positive buzz,” says Mavi.

It was at NCA, Nagarkoti met Varun Aaron, the Jharkhand and Rajasthan Royals fast bowler who has played nine Tests and nine One-day Internationals. “He (Aaron) said he too had a lot of problems with his back and had to remodel his action and get stronger. And Rahul Dravid would speak from time to time. He would tell me that the more positive you are, the more you think of cricket the better you will be. Work as hard as you can to ensure that you don’t have to go through such times again,” says Nagarkoti. Dravid, head of cricket at NCA, was the under-19 coach in the 2018 World Cup which India won.

Dravid had also told Nagarkoti about Pat Cummins’ struggle with injuries before becoming the world’s No.1 Test bowler. Cummins will be a teammate and Nagarkoti has said injury-management would be a big part of their conversation.

Nagarkoti also draws inspiration from Ashish Nehra’s long-drawn battle with injuries in an international career that spanned nearly 9 years. “He kept coming back, his last comeback after so many years was a great achievement,” says Nagarkoti referring to Nehra, then almost 37, returning to the India T20 team in 2016 after five years. “He (Nehra) always tells me if you are a pace bowler, you will have to deal with some problem or the other. How you handle it, how you get stronger is entirely up to you. He has inspired me to get stronger.”

Back after long spells of no cricket - Mavi’s hasn’t played after his back played up in December 2019 - KKR’s Kiwi bowling coach Kyle Mills eased them into nets in the UAE last month. Mills, says Mavi, has been good “because he has a lot of international experience and clear answers to everything we ask at nets.” Mavi says Mills also gives a lot of options and letting the bowler choose what is best at nets.

That the wickets would tire and aid spinners going deeper into the tournament has been a recurrent theme ahead of IPL13. On Thursday, Mumbai Indians’ skipper Rohit Sharma referred to the Asia Cup in 2018 where “there was a lot of difference between the wicket in the first game and the final.” Sharma also spoke about the need to adjust the length and said some reverse swing would happen.

Mavi, 21, accepts the strips wouldn’t be pacer-friendly like Eden which has led to KKR investing in young Indians fast bowlers - Nagarkoti is 20 and Prasidh Krishna 24 - but says it won’t be too different from playing in Delhi where it is dry. “At practice, we have got used to that somewhat. After a couple of games, we will be used completely. It won’t be as if we are going to play in England.”

For the first time since they were signed as cubs, Shubman Gill, Mavi and Nagarkoti are available for KKR. Mavi and he talk a lot about workload and if the “body is feeling tight,” says Nagarkoti. “For India under-19, we had a good partnership,” says Mavi. Both took nine wickets in six games in the World Cup where Gill finished with 372 runs and Tom Banton, who joined KKR this season, 233.

In the time they repaired their bodies, Gill established himself as a top-order batsman with four half-centuries in 27 games over two seasons. Banton too has caught the eye in the Big Bash and for England. Mavi and Nagarkoti know they have some catching up to do.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket
131,TikTok-Oracle deal: Here’s everything you need to know about it,"It has been a busy couple of weeks for ByteDance. Over the past couple of weeks, the company that owns the popular short-video sharing app TikTok has been busy negotiating a deal that would salvage its business in the US and enable its users in the country to continue using the platform.

ByteDance, ever since the US President imposed sweeping bans on US transactions on the company, has been working feverishly in carving out a deal that would allow the China-based company to hold a minority stake in TikTok’s US business while addressing the concerns raised by the Trump administration over the app posing a security threat to the US people.

It held negotiations with Microsoft, whose bid it later rejected. “ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft...We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users while protecting national security interests,” Microsoft said in a statement shortly after ByteDance rejected its proposal.

ByteDance also held negotiations with Oracle, which eventually helped the company to close a deal before the deadline for the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration came into effect, that is, September 20.

""I have given the deal my blessing...I approve the deal in concept,"" President Trump said as he gave his approval to the historic deal. The deal, however, is yet to get approval by authorities in China, where ByteDance is based.

TikTok-Oracle deal

TikTok, on Thursday, announced that it was partnering with Oracle and Walmart in order to address the concerns raised by the US authorities and make the platform available to the users in the country. As a part of the deal, TikTok will become TikTok Global, a technology company that is based in the US. Oracle will be TikTok Global’s trusted technology partner. It will also be responsible for hosting the company’s US data and securing all the associated computer systems such that it addresses all the concerns raised by the local authorities.

ByteDance is also working on a deal with Walmart over a commercial partnership. Both the companies, that is Oracle and Walmart, in a TikTok Global pre-IPO financing round wherein the two companies combined will be able to acquire a 20% cumulative stake in the company. Existing ByteDance investors such as Sequoia Capital, General Altantic and Coatue Capital will also be able to participate in the pre-IPO financing round.

Additionally, TikTok Global will set up a headquarter in the US and bring nearly 25,000 jobs across the country.

While announcing the deal, TikTok’s Interim head Vanessa Pappas penned a note wherein she informed the users that the popular video-sharing platform wasn’t going anywhere. She also thanked the users for their support. “We want to thank all of the members of our community who have shown tremendous support...TikTok is what it is because of all of you...This is just the beginning for TikTok, and we're so excited to be with you in this journey for the long run,” she wrote in a blog post.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-viral

133,From leasing an electric vehicle to charging it: Here are all questions answered,"An electric car is cleaner and, over time, will save you money. No brainer? Read on.

Lease, Don’t Buy

Battery technology is improving so fast—providing longer range at a lower cost—that a new electric vehicle can become obsolete within the span of a three-year lease. You don’t want to be the one holding that fast-depreciating asset: “When we look at used values for electric vehicles, they’re not good,"" says Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds. On the flip side, there are bargains to be had in the used EV market, and that’s a good way to reduce your carbon footprint.

Not Everybody Gets a Tax Credit

A US federal income tax credit of as much as $7,500 on the purchase of a new EV or ­plug-in hybrid comes with a catch: Once an automaker sells 200,000 of them, the credit phases out, dropping to $3,750 for six months, then $1,875 for six months. Then it expires entirely. Tesla and General Motors Co. hit the cap more than a year ago and no longer qualify for the credit. Ford, Nissan, and Toyota have all crossed 100,000 but should have at least a couple of years before a phaseout. Credits also vary by how much power the car draws from the battery. To see where a particular model stands, check the Internal Revenue Code Section 30D. Also, some states and utility companies offer incentives. Go to the US Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center website for a state-by-state list.

It’s Not All Luxury

Thanks to Tesla Inc., big automakers are scrambling to grab some of the luxury EV market. But there are plenty of modest hatchbacks out there. These so-called compliance cars—they help automakers meet emissions standards—often sit on dealership lots, ignored until rebates are offered. And leasing a Renault Zoe is essentially free in Germany, where state support allowed dealership chain Autohaus Koenig to offer a lease for the battery-powered Zoe that’s entirely covered by subsidies.

There are two types of personal chargers: Level 1 is a standard three-prong, 120-volt outlet and the charger cable that typically comes with the car. At 2 to 5 miles of range per hour, a full recharge can take more than a day. Level 2 requires a dedicated circuit and 240-volt outlet (the kind typically used by clothes dryers). These add 10 to 60 miles of range per hour, ideal for overnight fill-ups. The average cost to install a Level 2 charger is $1,400, according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation. The cost of power varies widely in the US, from about 30¢ per kilowatt-hour in Hawaii to less than a dime in Louisiana. But some states have begun to offer time-of-use plans with cheaper rates for off-peak times or even separate discounted EV meters, as in California. The Alternative Fuels Data Center lists what’s available where. The average annual cost to charge a standard EV in the US is $485, while a year’s worth of gas for an internal combustion engine (ICE) car is $1,117, according to a 2018 study by the University of Michigan’s Sustainable Worldwide Transportation group.

Charging on the Go

The EV industry hit a major milestone in August when it crossed 1 million public charging plugs worldwide, according to a tally from BloombergNEF. Unfortunately for US drivers, most of those are in China and Europe. There are just under 80,000 public chargers in the US, including Tesla’s proprietary network of about 17,000. Most are in big cities and are Level 2. Fast chargers, also known as Level 3, which can add 60 to 80 miles of range in 20 minutes, are harder to find. Excluding Tesla’s network, there are fewer than 6,500 in the US PlugShare, a free app, can help you locate them and tell you if they’re already in use.

Great Acceleration

Even the most basic EV is fun to drive. Electric motors provide instant torque: When you punch the pedal, power goes from the motor to the wheels in a fraction of a second. This makes for responsiveness that combustion engines—with their crankshafts, gears, and transmissions— struggle to match. Regenerative braking, where the motor pulls power from the wheels during deceleration to recharge the battery, adds to the distinctive feel of driving electric. Most EVs allow drivers to choose a level of regeneration. The most aggressive settings can feel jerky but allow for the possibility of “one-pedal"" driving, where you rarely touch the brake.

As per Car and Driver: Acceleration from 30 to 50 mph:2018 Nissan Leaf: 2.8 seconds2018 Ford Mustang EcoBoost Premium: 3.1 seconds.

Range Anxiety? Don’t Sweat It

The possibility of running out of juice on the road isn’t nearly as bad as it’s made out to be: 95% of car trips in the US are 30 miles or less and more than three-quarters are 10 miles or less, according to the US Department of Transportation. Weather matters: Below-freezing temperatures and running the heater can sap more than 40% of the range from EVs, while the air conditioner on a hot day cuts 17%, according to a AAA study. Heavy-footed driving and steep ascents can make dashboard range estimates drop fast enough to make drivers sweat.

What You Won’t Miss

While the sticker price of an EV can be high compared with that of a typical car—even after tax incentives—the savings in fuel and maintenance can help make up the difference. EVs don’t need oil changes. And their drivetrains have fewer moving parts than any counterparts with ICEs. That helps keep maintenance costs down. According to an analysis by BloombergNEF, the total cost of ownership for midsize EVs will be on par with ICE cars in 2025 and lower afterward. But batteries degrade over time. When telematics company Geotab analyzed the performance of more than 6,000 EVs, it found the average battery capacity declined 6.1% in the first three years.

134,Tesla-heavy fund bought more shares after carmaker got ‘slapped’,"The record plunge in Tesla Inc. that shaved $82 billion from its value in just one day wasn’t exactly a reason for Cathie Wood to hit the sell button. In fact, she piled even further on the shares -- the top holding in one of this year’s most-successful ETFs.

“I was happy to see [Tesla] get slapped,"" said Wood, who manages the $8.4 billion ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund. “We wait for those sorts of days where there is outright fear. If we think the stock has dropped enough, we’ll move in, and we did.""

Tesla plunged 21% earlier this month after missing out on being included in the S&P 500 and on news of a partnership between competitors Nikola Corp. and General Motors Co. The slide was a reason for ARKK to boost its position in the maker of electric cars to 10.7% from 9.9% on Sept. 8. Since then, the shares have rallied almost 35%, and jumped as much as 6.5% on Friday after analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush raised their price targets ahead of the automaker’s “Battery Day"" event next week.

In a turbulent year of market swings and rapidly changing trends, Wood’s funds have been among the best performers. ARKK, along with her Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG), have each returned more than 78% in 2020.

Aside from seeing Tesla’s plunge as a buying opportunity, the founder of New York-based Ark Investment Management said the rebound was a sign of resiliency for the market.

“When I don’t see enough worry, then I start worrying,"" said Wood. “I’m happy now that more people are worrying about more things. I always say the strongest bull markets climb a wall of worry.""

ARKK has ballooned in assets this year, attracting more than $4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s in part due to its bets on Tesla, which has surged almost 430% in 2020, compared with a gain of about 5% for the S&P 500. And Wood says she expects the bets will continue to pay off.

135,No plans to bring electric vehicle platform to India in near future: Volkswagen,"German automotive major Volkswagen Group on Thursday said it has no plans to bring its MEB platform, the backbone of its global electric vehicle (EV) offensive, to India in the near future as the market is not yet mature and the EV infrastructure is not developed.

The Group said it is observing the developments in the Indian automotive market and will bring its EVs as and when the market is ready.

""We always have an observation on what happens in India. We have a plant in India with our company Skoda. We have combined 'production society' there, where we want to produce combustible cars for India. At the moment, there is no decision taking to bring the MEB to India,"" VW Brand CEO Ralf Brandstatter told reporters in a video conference.

Asked if the Group would wait for infrastructure to improve in countries like India or if the increasing customer base in bigger car segments is good enough for VW Group to bring its EVs such as the electric car ID.3, he said, ""We are observing all countries if they are mature for electro-mobility.""

Stating that the group will go there when the market is ready, Brandstatter said, ""At the moment, we do not see this market is mature.""

These markets need to develop their infrastructure, Brandstatter said adding that in markets like India, e-mobility is still expensive.

He said EV infrastructure development and pricing ""need to go close together"" but ""we are monitoring, when they are ready, we will also go to these markets"".

The VW Group is starting the global roll-out of its MEB (modular electric brand) platform with its upcoming ID.4 compact electric sports utility vehicle.

""The (electric car) ID.3 is taking to the road at the moment (in Europe) and will be soon followed by the ID.4. These are the two trailblazers of the new climate friendly mobility. Further model, ID.5 will follow next year,"" Brandstatter said.

While the world premiere of the ID.4 will be held in a few days, deliveries to customers are scheduled to begin before the end of this year, he said.

""The VW Group plans to produce 26 million EVs by 2029, some 20 million alone based on the MEB platform,"" Brandstatter said adding by 2024 the group ""we will be investing 33 billion (euro) in e-mobility throughout the group"".

137,Porsche uses high-power charging trucks as mobile EV charging spots for Taycan,"Porsche has come up with a unique solution to offer charging facility for its electric sports car owners. To provide adequate infrastructure, the carmaker has deployed high-power charging trucks that offer mobile charging on demand.

The trailers’ technical specifications speak for themselves. With a power rating of 3.2 megawatts, ten Taycan can be charged simultaneously at maximum speed. The battery buffer storage unit has a capacity of 2.1 megawatt hours.

This means that up to 30 Taycan in total can be charged by the energy storage unit. The latter is generally recharged with renewable power from the power grid. For example, during a three-week customer event in the Portuguese city of Portimao in November 2019, the power came directly from the nearby photovoltaic systems. The trailers can be recharged very quickly – under good conditions, they are fully charged again within four hours.

The Hungaroring in Budapest was the venue for a special Porsche Track Experience just a few days ago, where “Soul on Track"" offered customers the opportunity to test the Taycan on a circuit. Such driving events present organisers with a particular challenge, however: when a large number of Taycan cars need to be charged quickly and simultaneously, the local infrastructure isn’t always up to the job.

Without a satisfactory solution on the market, Porsche wasted no time in creating its own. Along with its partner in the project – the German company “ads-tec"" – it has produced seven mobile charging trucks with a proprietary charging system and buffer storage unit.

“We have now used the trucks at numerous events all over Europe and have carried out around 5,000 charging operations – sometimes at extreme temperatures down to minus 40 degrees.

""All the government agencies in Delhi including municipal corporations, PWD, Transport department, DTC, DMRC, DDA, among others will identify concessional locations within their jurisdictions in the next two weeks for setting up charging stations,"" said the statement.

(Also read: Delhi poised to be the nerve center of India's electric vehicle revolution)

Delhi government will aggregate these locations and work out a unified model for setting up 200 charging spots in the city in the next one year, it said.

The Electric Vehicle Policy 2020 was notified last month by the Transport department of Delhi government.

In view of the multiplicity of agencies in Delhi, the task of devising and implementing a coordinated strategy for setting up charging infrastructure in Delhi has been entrusted to the charging infrastructure working group.

“Delhi government will soon be rolling out financial incentives promised under the EV policy,"" Shah said.

Various agencies including At Discoms, EESL, DMRC, Delhi Transco Ltd., NDMC, East MCD and North MCD gave detailed presentation of their proposals during the meeting, for rapidly augmenting the public charging infrastructure as well as private charging infrastructure in the city, the statement said.

""It was agreed at the meeting that given the emphasis of Delhi EV Policy on mass adoption of electric two-wheeler and three-wheeler, the charging infrastructure should focus primarily on setting up a large number of slow-charging stations consisting of AC-001 charging points (3.3 kW each) and limited number of DC-001 fast chargers (15 kW each),"" it said.

Developing a wide network of battery swapping stations was also identified as a key priority.

Once the location mapping exercise is completed, Delhi Transco Ltd, which is the state nodal agency for setting up charging infrastructure, will implement a coordinated plan for setting up of 200 charging stations at the most prominent places in the city, with subsidy support from Delhi government, the statement said.

In addition to public charging stations, establishing charging facilities at malls, office complexes, group housing societies, hotels, education institutions, hospitals and other restricted spaces, was also identified as a priority at the meeting.

Given that these premises have high capacity commercial connections, it was discussed that setting up of a large number of slow-charging points at these facilities would be inexpensive and a quick way of setting up thousands of additional charging points in the city, it said.

Dialogue and Development Commission and Delhi Transco Ltd. were entrusted with the role of working out a special scheme on the lines of RESCO model for rooftop solar plants, to empanel energy operators who could then be engaged by the owners of these premises to invest, install and maintain charging points for public use within these facilities, added the statement.

139,"Small is sensible for Honda, gives glimpse into new EV concept after e's release","Honda managed to corner some much-needed attention in the world of electric vehicles with the launch of its first electric car called simply as 'e'. The compact EV may not have the range of a Tesla Model Y, nor the performance of a Porsche Taycan EV but has still found favour as a practical city commuting option with retro styling and a modern cabin. Small cars for big gains may be the way forward in the EV world for Honda as the Japanese car maker has now given a glimpse into its latest electric concept which is expected to be showcased at the upcoming Beijing Auto Show 2020.

Honda's tryst with electric power has not been a road of roses with its electric sedans failing to find the intended mark. The e however has put the car maker back on track, a track that could soon see the company roll out more such EVs of compact dimensions and practical city commute applications. The teaser image of its new concept EV points to this same direction and reveals a stylish front profile with razor-blade headlights, dash strip DRLs, prominent Honda badge on the grille and a bulk bonnet with twin character lines. Although only the front profile is visible in the teaser images revealed, it is clear that the concept is a small vehicle, one that seeks to ditch the retro appeal of the e for a more pronounced an sporty visual character.

While Honda e (right) has a retro visual appeal which is more rounded, the teaser image of Honda's new EV showcases an emphasis on an angular, athletic design language.

Reports suggest that the production version of this concept EV could be made available in China alone, at least to begin with. That China is the world's largest EV market means that manufacturers eye it with longing eyes. And because the auto industry here is on an upswing even as markets elsewhere struggle in Covid-19 times, Honda's focus on China may be justified.

The mass-market in China also tends to favour compact cars with local manufacturers vying with Tesla for a share of the EV pie. Tesla Model 3 has become a blockbuster here but rivals are plugging in to charge ahead and catch up.

He was replying to a query whether the reduction in GST on two-wheeler segment would be helpful in reviving the sector. ""It will definitely help and act as a tailwind for the industry against what we are seeing today, the headwinds from multiple sides,"" Guleria noted. Elaborating on the situation, he said that people want to preserve cash these days due to economic slowdown related uncertainties. Despite that people are still willing to take personal mobility options due to Covid-19 situation and in that case it will help if affordability of owning a two-wheeler improves, Guleria said.

The two-wheeler industry has been demanding for long reduction in GST on two -wheelers from 28 per cent to 18 cent. They argue that a two-wheeler is basic necessity for transportation of millions of medium income group households in the country. Last month, even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman contended that the segment merits a GST rate revision.

When asked about start of production from newly constructed assembly line in Gujarat-based facility, Guleria said the infrastructure is ready but units won't roll out soon. ""Since we have sufficient capacity with existing plants we are not going to start production there. It will depend on how the market behaves and recover and then we will be ready to begin the production,"" he noted. With already having strong position in scooter segment, HMSI is now looking to expand its motorcycle business in the country.

The company's market share in the domestic bike segment currently stands at around 14 per cent. In August its wholesales were second only to market leader Hero MotoCorp. Commenting on the segment, Guleria said: ""It is one area where we will have to work on both sales network as well as product portfolio."" In terms of products, the company will have to bring models at both lower and upper ends of the pyramid, he noted. ""We need to expand on both sides of the spectrum. At the lower end which comprises products for rural areas we are some time away from coming up with more affordable models from Honda side but at the same time our expansion has started on the premium side with launches of products like XBlade, Hornet 2.0,"" Guleria said. He said there were new product launches on the anvil in the premium segment. Guleria said the company's bike segment business also required sales network expansion. ""But unfortunately we had to slow down a bit as the total size of the market has dropped. We need to be very sure about the viability of the network partners who invest with us,"" he said.

It will be only when the market starts recovering and also when the company has more affordable products in its portfolio that further expansion of existing network will happen, he added. The company has already begun work to expand its Big Wing sales network from where it retails models like CB300R, Africa Twin, Gold Wing and Fireblade. ""Focus right now is on the premium bike business. Most of the major towns will see the premium bike Big Wings showrooms coming up..expansion of network in rural areas will be however aligned with the introduction of more affordable bikes."" The company currently has just one such showroom in Gurgaon. ""Now such showrooms will keep coming up. We are looking at close to 50 new outlets by the end of this financial year,"" Guleria said.

On the current business environment, Guleria said the company has seen enquiries picking up with 75 per cent increase in people visiting showrooms this month as compared to the same period of August. People have now started coming to the showrooms and retail sales in the first 15 days of September have been much better than the same period of August, he noted. Supply chain has improved a lot and the company is not facing any significant issues at its four manufacturing facilities, Guleria said. ""With improvement in supply chain, we don't have any difficulty and the current production level is good enough for the existing market demand,"" he added.

He further said: ""There is still a bit of gap between demand and supply but we should not be going overboard in building those capacities just on the hope of upcoming festive season and we are cautious that we are not going to build up similar level of inventory which we had in previous years."" There were some demand and supply gaps for certain models but that was being sorted out at local levels, Guleria said.

Stating that Triumph Motorcycles India has been focusing on how to continuously create excitement in the industry, Farooq said, ""We all know there is stress in the industry right now. The focus from our side is to continuously give reason for customers to come to our showroom and buy our products.""

Stressing on the company's strategy, he said, ""I think with this focus on products and aggressive pricing strategy that we have adopted, we are kind of steering much better than the overall industry right now. We have seen some recovery of the brand in the last three months, from June onwards.""

He said with premium motorcycles being discretionary purchases, the recovery is slower while the lower engine capacity motorcycles segment has gained traction as the importance of personal commute due to the pandemic drove people to buy such affordable vehicles.

When asked about expectations from the festive season, Farooq said, ""We are cautiously optimistic. The positives for us have been the traction on our new product launches, for example the new Tiger 900 which we launched recently is right now on booking and availability is a concern over there. Similarly, Street RRR is also on booking right now. Rocket, even after 7 months of launch it continues to be on booking.""

Commenting on the company's plans to bring its pre-owned motorcycle programme 'Triumph Approved', he said it was delayed by two to three months because of Covid-19.

""Finally, we are going to launch the Triumph Approved programme in India. It will be a national programme. Our dealers are going to repurchase and sell these Triumph motorcycles. This will additionally give us a good entry price point to our brand. In these times that is also going to be a positive initiative,"" Farooq said.

When asked how soon the programme would be launched, he said, ""I am hopeful it should be live somewhere in October first half. We will start with three dealerships in Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru and in a month or two we will be live across the country.""

The application is being used on individual vehicle sections through to complex production stages at BMW's pilot plant located in the Research & Innovation Centre in Munich, Germany.

The use of AR goggles allow real geometries on a vehicle body to be overlaid with true-to-scale holographic 3D models. This helps in assessing a range of concept variants and assembly processes for future series vehicles flexibly and cost-efficiently without the need for too many test setups.

(Also read: How Artificial Intelligence will help Volkswagen boost production by 30 per cent)

Vehicles and their components are visualised on a platform linked to the BMW’s product data management system while Computer-aided design (CAD) files of components are drag-and-dropped to the AR goggles. These are then used to reproduce the data in 3D and their original size in a realistic environment. “The AR goggles and CAD data allow to find out much more quickly whether the production worker will be able to fit the component properly later on, in series production,"" explains Michael Schneider, head of Complete Vehicle at the BMW Pilot Plant.

BMW pilot plant in Munich

Since AR application is controlled by hand, allowing direct interaction with virtual components, even a simple hand movement is enough to modify the size or position and angle of components. In addition, cross-sections can be created to provide a view of the vehicle’s inner structures. In fact, people at different locations around the world can also use multi-user mode to team up and review designs and concepts together, and identify any errors.

153,Anand Mahindra to gift tractor to Bihar farmer who carved 3-km canal in 30 years,"The man who single-handedly dup up a 3 kms-long tunnel in 30 years to irrigate his parched farmlands, has won a reward of recognition from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra. Impressed by the herculean effort taken by Laungi Bhuyian, a farmer from Gaya district in Bihar, Mahindra has decided to let him use a Mahindra tractor for him to use for agriculture.

Anand Mahindra took to Twitter to lend a helping hand to Laungi Bhuyian. Replying to a message seeking help for the farmer, Anand Mahindra wrote, ""As you know, I had tweeted that I think his canal is as impressive a monument as the Taj or the Pyramids. We at @MahindraRise would consider it an honour to have him use our tractor.""

उनको ट्रैक्टर देना मेरा सौभाग्य होगा। As you know, I had tweeted that I think his canal is as impressive a monument as the Taj or the Pyramids. We at @MahindraRise would consider it an honour to have him use our tractor. How can our team reach him @rohinverma2410 ? https://t.co/tnGC5c4j8b — anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) September 19, 2020





He also went on to ask Bhuyian's messenger on Twitter to reach out with Mahindra team to get the tractor delivered to the farmer.

Bhuyian recently attracted a lot of attention for completing the 3-km-long canal to take rainwater coming down from nearby hills to fields of his village, Kothilawa in Lahthua area of Gaya. His feat reminds one of Dashrath Manjhi, a fellow Bihar resident, who took 22 years to carve a road in the hills after his wife died falling off the mountain.

Speaking to news agency ANI, he said, ""It took me 30 years to dig this canal which takes the water to a pond in the village.""

""For the last 30 years, I would go to the nearby jungle to tend my cattle and dig out the canal. No one joined me in this endeavour... Villagers are going to cities to earn a livelihood but I decided to stay back,"" he was quoted by ANI.

The main means of livelihood for the people here are farming and animal husbandry.

According to the local journalist, through whom Bhuyian passed his message on Twitter, the farmer wanted nothing more than a tractor to plough his field. Anand Mahindra not only responded to Bhuyian's request, but said it would be an honour to provide him with a tractor from Mahindra to help him farm with ease.

154,Kia aims to sell 1 lakh units of 'Made in India' Sonet in a year,"Kia Motors India is going big and dreaming bigger with its latest offering in India - Sonet. The sub-compact SUV was launched here on Friday at a starting price of ₹6.71 lakh (ex showroom, pan-India, introductory) and the company informed that it has already received 25,000 bookings for the vehicle. And while not all bookings always convert into buys, the Korean company is looking at selling 1 lakh units of Sonet in a year's time from now.

Sonet will be manufactured for the Indian market first and then exported to other countries from Kia's state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Andhra Pradesh's Anantpur. It is the second 'Made in India' product from the car maker. While the company assures that the standard of Sonet for all markets will be the same, it is hoping this and other highlights will help the vehicle not just make a mark in its segment but take a lead. While the target of 1 lakh in a year may seem ambitious, especially considering the current market scenario, Kia is also looking at exporting 50,000 units from here to elsewhere in the same time frame.

Sonet's main rivalry is against Hyundai Venue which was first launched in India in May of 2019. Hyundai came close to the 1 lakh mark by selling 97,400 units in the ensuing 12 months with another 7,400 units sold in international markets.

155,"Volkswagen teases a new sub-compact SUV, names it Taos","Volkswagen has teased a new sub-compact SUV that is scheduled to be unveiled next month. The carmaker announced the name for its new compact SUV - the Volkswagen Taos. The Taos model was designed specifically for the North American region and, as such, the name was chosen to resonate with American customers.

“We’re thrilled to announce the name for the newest member of the Volkswagen family,"" said Hein Schafer, Senior Vice President for Product Marketing and Strategy, Volkswagen of America. “It was important to choose a name that really embodied the nature of the car and the town of Taos, New Mexico was a perfect fit. It’s a small city that offers big things—from outdoor adventure to arts and design and great cuisine.""

“We are excited that Volkswagen has named their sport utility vehicle after the town of Taos,"" said Taos Mayor Dan Barrone. “It’s a great opportunity for our community to share its rich history and culture alongside Volkswagen with its unique and rich history and culture.""

The Volkswagen Taos will slot under the Tiguan, and is the second proof point of Volkswagen’s doubling-up SUV strategy following the launch of Atlas Cross Sport earlier this year. The carmaker claims that Taos will offer great value, excellent fuel economy, and great packaging, as well as advanced infotainment and driver-assistance features. The official reveal will take place next month, on October 13.

The teaser image gives a hint that the Taos will look somewhat like the Tiguan, but is likely to be smaller in proportion. In some markets like China, Volkswagen has a similar vehicle on offer, which is called Tharu. The thin LED strip flanking the headlights is reminiscent of the Tiguan. The LED strip run along the front of the vehicle to span the area between the headlights.

The Volkswagen Taos is likely to be powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine. In China, the Tharu is powered by a 1.4-litre turbocharged engine making 148 horsepower and a 2.0-litre engine with 184 hp power. Both are offered with a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox.

The town of Taos is home to 6,000 people, and boasts a 400-year history and a 1,000-year-old Native American community just a few miles from the centre of town. It’s notable for its artist community, world-class ski resort, and stunning landscapes, including vast plains, the Sangre de Cristo mountains, and the spectacular Rio Grande Gorge.

Incidentally, Taos was also home to John Muir, an engineer turned mechanic, and author of “How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step procedures for the Compleat Idiot."" First published in 1969, and illustrated by local artist Peter Aschwanden, this counter-culture guide to Volkswagen repairs quickly developed a popular following. The book, started in Muir’s Taos shop, has helped keep countless VW models running, from Beetles and Buses to Type 3 and Type 4 models.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com

The permit allows Zoox to operate two vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, a step up from approval it received four years ago that required the presence of a person to take control if needed, the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement.

While some 60 companies have permission to conduct autonomous testing with a safety driver in California, Zoox joins Alphabet Inc. unit Waymo LLC, Nuro Inc. and AutoX Technologies in a small club of truly driverless testers in the state.

Zoox will be allowed to conduct tests on public roads within a designated area in San Mateo County near its headquarters in Foster City, California. The tests are allowed only under fair-weather conditions and on streets with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour.

Amazon agreed to buy Zoox in June to bolster the e-commerce giant’s ambitions in automated package delivery and ride-hailing.

It could be priced somewhere in the range of ₹2 lakh to ₹2.5 lakh, which will place it in the territory of the Royal Enfield bikes. Honda will use this chance to break RE's monopoly in the sub-400 cc cruiser segment since there is no other bike maker which sells in the same space, save for Jawa.

159,"Man falls asleep in Tesla self-driving car at 140 kmph, wakes up to legal action","In another blow for those advocating the many advantages of a self-driving vehicle, a man in Canada has been charged for dangerous driving and faces legal action after he allegedly fell asleep behind the wheels of a Tesla car on Autopilot. That the vehicle was at 140 kmph with the sleeping driver inside perhaps made the charges against the accused even more serious.

The incident took place near the town of Ponoka in Canada's Alberta province. In a tweet put out by local police department, it was informed that law enforcement were called in for action when the car was spotted. ""Alberta RCMP received a complaint of a car speeding on Hwy 2 near #Ponoka. The car appeared to be self-driving, travelling over 140 km/h with both front seats completely reclined & occupants appeared to be asleep,"" the tweet informed. ""The driver received a Dangerous Driving charge & summons for court.""

According to local news reports, the accused is a 20-year-old an that the speed limit on the stretch the car was on is 110 kmph. ""Nobody was looking out the windshield to see where the car was going,"" Police Sergeant Darrin Turnbull told Canadian public broadcaster CBC.

Tesla cars on Autopilot mode claim to be a safe driving option with CEO Elon Musk repeatedly claiming that the technology allows for eradicating incidents which can be caused by human errors. Even then, it is recommended - and mandated by law in many places, that a a driver is attentive and has hands on the steering even if the car is in self-driving mode.

For now, Tesla's Autopilot mode does not let complete autonomous driving kick in but offers several driving assist features like auto acceleration, auto braking etc which allows for less human intervention. Sleeping inside such a vehicle, therefore, is not just absolutely reckless but illegal as well.

161,Kia Sonet price breakdown: How does it face off against Hyundai Venue?,"Kia Sonet was officially launched in India on Friday at a starting price of ₹6.71 lakh (ex showroom) after a highly-anticipated wait which began since the concept Sonet was showcased at Auto Expo 2020 in February. Sonet has since managed to generate a whole lot of buzz and seeks to make a mark in the sub-compact SUV segment which is presently dominated by Hyundai Venue. While Sonet is looking at its design on the outside, features inside, variants and drive capabilities to mount a massive challenge, its pricing structure is where its real test is at.





Sonet HTE is the base trim and those on an extremely tight budget would be eyeing this option. Its price is already mentioned above.

Sonet HTK is priced from ₹7.59 lakh, HTK+ is priced at ₹8.45 lakh, HTX and HTX+ start at ₹9.99 lakh and ₹11.65 lakh, respectively. The Sonet GTX+ is getting the maximum traction since pre-launch bookings were opened. Its pricing has been kept at ₹11.99 lakh.

Kia Sonet's detailed price list:

The Kia Sonet starts from ₹ 6.71 lakh and stretches up to ₹ 11.99 lakh.

So how does Kia Sonet measure up in terms of pricing against the enormously popular Hyundai Venue?

Kia Sonet is the latest kid on the block in the sub-compact SUV segment.

Venue starts at a price point of ₹6.75 lakh for the E petrol variant. Next in line is S petrol which has a price tag of ₹7.45 lakh while E diesel is next in the price ascendancy order at ₹8.14 lakh. S Plus petrol is priced at ₹8.36 lakh while S Turbo petrol - a popular choice - has an asking price of ₹8.51 lakh. S Diesel is next and one will have to pay ₹9.05 lakh.

Hyundai Venue Sport offers a more striking look courtesy cosmetic additions in red accents all around. (Photo: Sabyasachi Dasgupta/HTAuto)

The first auto transmission option in the Venue comes in the S Turbo DCT which is priced at ₹9.65 lakh. Then there is the SX Turbo petrol manual priced at ₹9.84 lakh. The dual tone version is ₹10,000 more expensive.

iMT is a popular choice for convenient driving option as it does not have a clutch while it retains the gearbox. SX Sport iMT is priced at ₹10.25 lakh.

From here on the pricing structure of Venue is as follows:

SX Diesel Sport manual diesel - ₹10.30 lakh

SX Dual Tone manual diesel - ₹10.35 lakh

SX Opt Turbo manual petrol - ₹10.90 lakh

SX Opt iMT petrol - ₹11.20 lakh

SX Opt Turbo DT manual petrol - ₹11.25 lakh

SX Opt manual diesel - ₹11.46 lakh

SX Opt Sport manual diesel - ₹11.52 lakh

SX Plus Turbo DCT DT auto petrol - ₹11.63 lakh.

While the huge number of variants and trims on both Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue can get a bit intimidating for new buyers, it is important to note here that while Sonet starts around the same price point as the Venue, it is the Hyundai top-end that has the slight advantage when it comes to the price at the absolute top diesel variant vs Sonet GTX+ diesel manual and GTX+ petrol iMT . That said, the feature list on the top-end Sonet is even more exhaustive than on the Venue and those looking at getting their hands behind a brand new wheel would likely prefer the newer Korean sibling.

162,Tata Nexon becomes the first Indian car to be published on the IDIS,"Tata Motors today announced that the Tata Nexon, its popular compact SUV, has become the first Indian car to be published on the prestigious International Dismantling Information System (IDIS) platform for End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV).

This means Tata Motors will make the entire life cycle of its products sustainable, from the development of ultra-low/zero emission vehicles to responsible dismantling and recycling of the vehicle at the final ELV stage.

IDIS, which is a central repository of ‘Manufacturer Compiled Information’, is used by 25+ global manufacturers from over 40 countries across Europe and Asia and Tata Nexon is the first Indian car to join this elite group.

Tata Motors will provide all relevant information for responsible vehicle handling, starting with information about draining automotive fluids, the neutralisation of airbags and seat belt tensioners and all the way up to the dismantling of components containing particularly hazardous substances. This will now enable the Indian Authorised Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (AVSF) to undertake environmentally safe dismantling practices recommended by Tata Motors and implement them to work towards a cleaner environment.

164,Govt asks auto industry to lower costs to boost sales instead of seeking tax cut,"India's tax policy on automobiles has been quite consistent for the past three decades and the industry should strive for greater efficiency levels to bring down costs rather than expect tax cuts, government sources said on Thursday.

""These companies should cut down cost of manufacturing by reducing royalty payments to their parent companies abroad instead of asking the government to reduce Goods and Services Tax (GST), said a senior official of the Finance Ministry.

Government policies have allowed foreign investments and incentivised domestic automobile manufacturing by providing reasonable protection from imports. The industry on its part has delivered. It has contributed by way of large investments and employment.

""But all of a sudden, the dissent in some quarters on tax rates on automobile is surprising,"" said the official pointing out that several concessions have been provided to electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles to encourage their use.

Amid the Covid-19 economic slowdown, auto industry leaders have been demanding reduction in GST rates to shore up demand as weak consumer sentiment has crippled sales.

(Also read: Toyota, Maruti among many to highlight pain of high taxes in auto sector)

Another official said it is incorrect to claim that high taxes are driving down automobile demand. The fact of the matter is that Indian market and the consumers are a discerning lot.

File photo used for representational purpose only (REUTERS)

At the same time, most established players are used to regulatory and taxation environment and have flourished.

""If the regulatory environment was not conducive, it would be hard to imagine new players like Jeep, Kia Motors and MG investing heavily into manufacturing facilities in India. Companies which can feel the pulse of Indian consumer and deliver accordingly are ruling the roost.""

Government sources say the GST rates on automobiles are less than what value added tax and excise duty rate used to be before the introduction of uniform taxation across the country.

(Also read: Indian taxes keep Toyota focused on plant utilisation not expansion)

Besides, the GST on automobiles is in the highest across the globe without much exception. Japan, for example, has three types of taxes on automobiles -- once on purchase, then an annual automobile tax based on engine size and finally a weight tax at inspections required once every two years.

Besides, there are road usage charges. Further, high parking charges are common across the globe. Most of the countries provide certain concessions to electric vehicles. Given this, it will be unfair to claim that the GST rates in India are astounding or a demand dampener, they said.

165,Sonet launched in India: Five key highlights of Kia's latest offering,"Kia Sonet was officially launched in India at a starting price point of ₹6.71 lakh (ex showroom, pan-India, introductory). Sonet enters a tight but lucrative sub-compact SUV space and is looking at creating the same level of success that Seltos - Kia's debut product in India enjoyed. And then some more.

HT Auto test drove the Kia Sonet recently and here are the five big highlights of the car that were observed:

Highlight 5 - Kia, much like Hyundai, has chosen to persist with the diesel engines at a time when many are giving it a miss. While the demand for petrol variants are high, those in the SUV segment are also reportedly eyeing diesel engines with the same level of excitement. That Sonet diesel also comes with an extremely capable auto transmission option is like the cherry on the proverbial cake.

Highlight 4 - Mileage is still one of the core factors that influence buying decisions among the Indian audience. Here is a glimpse into how much fuel Sonet sips:

Kia Sonet mileage figures.

Highlight 3 - Want an automatic transmission? Sure. Need the thrill of a manual? Of course. Want the best of both worlds? Sonet has it. While Hyundai Venue beat Sonet by offering clucth-less transmission option first, that Sonet also has this feature is great.

Highlight 2 - Speaking of features, Sonet is packed to the brim. The Indian car buying audience is always on the look out for more and more features and Kia seems to have the pulse on this buying factor. Something as simple and yet important as cooled phone charging space is testament to that. Add features like ventilated front seats and air purification system, and Sonet makes a solid case for Indian conditions.

Highlight 1 - Good looks is half the battle won in an SUV segment, say many. And in this regard, Kia designers seem to have worked overtime to give Sonet a striking face and overall visual appeal. Sonet GTX+ is especially striking to look at courtesy its sporty red accents and there is little wonder that this particular trim has reportedly gathered most attention in the pre-launch bookings phase.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com
166,Ford builds its most advanced factory to make electric truck,"Ford Motor Co., facing an onslaught of competition for its new battery-powered F-150 pickup, unveiled the high-tech factory that will produce the electric truck using self-driving transport sleds and robots collaborating with human workers.

The plant is going up inside Ford’s 92-year-old Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan, and will be the “most advanced facility we’ve got in the world,"" manufacturing chief Gary Johnson told reporters in a briefing Wednesday. The autonomous sleds will transport truck bodies from one station to the next, while robots help assemble the vehicles. The factory is scheduled to be completed next summer and begin building prototype electric F-150s.

Ford is spending $700 million to overhaul its Rouge complex as it wages a pitched battle to maintain decades of dominance in the pickup segment. Today it began building a redesigned version of its gasoline-fueled F-150, the company’s biggest money maker. Though it sold almost 900,000 F-Series trucks last year, Ford is playing catch-up with more recently revamped versions of its primary rivals: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Ram and General Motors Co.’s Chevrolet Silverado.

The second-largest U.S. automaker also is seeking to stake a substantial claim to the emerging market for electric trucks, which has seen a rash of new entrants, including Tesla Inc.’s Cybertruck, Rivian Automotive Inc.’s R1T and Nikola Corp.’s Badger.

Ford shares rose as much as 4.6% to a three-month high. The stock was up 3.1% to $7.24 at 12:28 p.m. in New York.

Ford said its electric truck, set to go on sale in 2022, will be the fastest and most powerful pickup it has ever produced. The automaker cast its competitors as “lifestyle trucks,"" saying the electric F-150 will double as a mobile generator capable of powering a job site or the driver’s home.

“This isn’t a gimmick,"" Chief Operating Officer and future CEO Jim Farley was scheduled to say during a ceremony at the Rouge on Thursday. “It’s a workhorse, not a showhorse destined for a shiny garage filled with four other luxury cars.""

Ford has invested more than a half-billion dollars in one of those new rivals: Rivian. The automaker is jointly developing an electric vehicle with the startup founded by R.J. Scaringe.

“We really like R.J. and what he’s doing because he’s standing up product, great product, commercial and retail,"" Farley told reporters after introducing the new F-150 on Thursday. “But our relationship is much broader. Don’t think of it as a transactional relationship for a vehicle. It’s a strategic investment.""

The automaker’s research found “very substantial demand"" that “focused on the work customer,"" Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s president of the Americas and international markets, told reporters on Wednesday. “It was enough for us to make this investment both in the product as well as the factory.""

The new 500,000 square-foot Rouge Electric Vehicle center will create 300 new jobs and also produce a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the F-150 that will go on sale sooner than the electric truck.

The two electrified models represent the future of the F-Series, according to the automaker.

“It sets the Rouge up with a long-term vision with new technology and battery-electric products with our most important vehicle,"" Johnson said.

167,Why China is becoming loss-making Nissan’s last line of defence,"As Nissan Motor Co. struggles to recover from a boardroom scandal surrounding Carlos Ghosn and a sales slump that threatens its alliance with Renault SA, China is emerging as its best bet for a turnaround.

Thanks to an early mover advantage and strategic partnership with Dongfeng Motor Group Co. in 2003, Nissan is one of the strongest Japanese passenger carmakers in China. It ranked fourth -- excluding multipurpose vehicles -- in June with a 6.7% share after Volkswagen AG’s two joint ventures and General Motors Co.’s tie-up with SAIC Motor Corp.

Former Chairman Ghosn, who was arrested in 2018 on financial misconduct charges and fled in a dramatic escape to Lebanon at the end of last year, called China a “new frontier"" when he unveiled Nissan’s push into Asia’s largest economy almost two decades ago. Now, the world’s biggest automobile market is looking more like a key line of defence as China’s economy returns to growth and demand for cars recovers. Nissan has staked its future on improving the quality of sales there, as well as in the US and at home in Japan.

“Weaker brands will be weaker and the stronger ones get stronger, and that’s an opportunity for us,"" said Shohei Yamazaki, president of Dongfeng Motor, the Wuhan-based firm that’s in a 50:50 joint venture with Nissan. “But once we fail to keep or improve our brand, then it becomes a risk. It’s easy to fall fast in China.""

Even as Nissan’s total retail volume fell about 11% in the 2019 fiscal year that ended in March, China has been something of a bright spot. Shipments there only slipped 1% and still comprised about one-third of Nissan’s global volume of 4.93 million units. Even so, with an aging lineup and restructuring costs, Nissan posted a loss of $6.2 billion in the latest fiscal year.

Brand Power

As China restarts its economy from a pandemic-induced shutdown, Nissan’s car shipments have been climbing steadily since April. However, after peaking in July at about 121,000 units, up 12% from a year earlier, August sales hit a road bump, dipping 2.4%.

“Nissan’s edge in China is its appealing brand power accumulated from competitive models over the years,"" said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association. “Yet it’s quite challenging for the company to compete with Toyota because the latter has proven its competitiveness in innovation and competency in winning over motorists for not only its Toyota brand, but also Lexus.""

Even so, Nissan’s Sylphy sedan, aimed at younger buyers, overtook Volkswagen’s Lavida as the best-selling model in the country in the first half, CPCA data show. Nissan’s lineup in China, which includes Altima sedans and X-Trail SUVs, has price tags ranging from 99,800 yuan to 234,800 yuan ($14,750 to $34,700).

“Nissan has established a strong presence in China and continues to grow with a focus on delivering customer satisfaction,"" Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta said in an emailed statement in response to questions from Bloomberg News.

Nissan and Dongfeng aim to boost total vehicle sales to 2.6 million units by 2022 as the country’s population gets richer and embraces car ownership. Nissan sold 1.55 million units in China during the latest fiscal year.

To do so, they’ll need to attract more buyers like 30-year-old Jimmy Zhang, an owner of a small restaurant in Beijing who bought a blue Qashqai compact SUV last year. “It’s cute and cool at the same time,"" he said. “Like other Japanese cars, it’s a very good bargain for the money.""

New Models

Zhang selected the model from a group of marques including VW and GM. He and his girlfriend, who often uses the car as a backdrop for social media pictures, liked its shape and colour, paying about 170,000 yuan.

As automakers fight for survival in the era of ride-sharing, autonomous driving and connected cars, gaining China market share is critical for future growth. Automobile sales in the nation accounted for almost 30% of the world’s total and the country was the only one that had an annual tally of more than 20 million units last year. China’s share of global vehicle sales is expected to inch up to about one-third this year, according to IHS Markit.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida says the next 12 months will be critical, adding that Nissan needs to introduce new models at a steady clip. “If Nissan delays even slightly, it will immediately be put in a weaker position,"" Yoshida said. “Toyota and Honda will constantly introduce new cars.""

Liu Song, a showroom manager at Nissan’s Wuhan Kaitai dealership, said that most buyers are retired public servants looking for cars similar to the ones they used during their careers.

“Many customers are coming to buy a second car for their family after the pandemic,"" said Song, who used to sell cars for Toyota at a dealership in Zhejiang. “Models like the Sylphy and Tiida have never been in short supply before in our store.""

168,Kia Sonet to launch on Friday: Price expectation of sub-compact SUV,"Kia Sonet, one of the most awaited cars in India, will finally go on sale on Friday (September 18). It is going to be the third product from Kia Motors India after the popular Seltos and the Carnival luxury MPV.

The Sonet sub-compact SUV will be placed in the hotly contested sub-4 metre SUV segment against the already established rivals such as Hyundai Venue, Tata Nexon and Mahindra XUV300.

Sonet has already made headlines in the past for the kind of features it promises to offer but in order to really set the segment on fire and make a name for itself, the pricing will have to be set right.

(Also Read: 2020 Kia Sonet first drive review: Is it worth the hype?)

Based on the inputs from several Kia dealerships, it will be safe to expect that Sonet may start from around ₹7 lakh in India. But in order to really make a mark, Kia may go for an even more aggressive entry price tag starting from around ₹6.70 lakh to ₹6.80 lakh. This price may, of course, rise in the future as Kia had used a similar strategy in case of Seltos. The SUV had received a minor hike as soon as the introductory offer ended within months of launch.

The expected entry level pricing of ₹7 lakh will help Sonet undercut its rivals such as Maruti Vitara Brezza, Mahindra XUV300 and Tata Nexon, all of which start at a slightly higher price tag of ₹7.34 lakh, ₹7.95 lakh and ₹6.99 lakh, respectively.

In short, Kia will most likely place the Sonet on the same lines as the Hyundai Venue which is currently the segment leader and is priced at ₹6.70 lakh.

The Sonet will be made available in dual trim just like the Seltos. There will be a Tech Line trim as well as the higher-spec GT Line trim. Prices for the top-of-the-line variants may extend somewhere up to ₹13 lakh.

171,Toyota Kirloskar Motor reiterates its commitment to Indian market,"Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) on Thursday said it remains deeply committed to the Indian market and its national objectives, refuting once again the claims by a senior company official earlier that it would stop further expansion in India due to high taxes.

The automaker, which sells models like Innova and Fortuner, said it has firm belief in the core strength of the country's economic growth potential and is fully committed to continually work towards contributing to economic development.

Keeping in sync with the vision of 'Grow India – Grow with India', during the past two decades of presence in the country, the company has worked tirelessly to invest in creation of a world-class talent pool and for building a strong competitive local supplier ecosystem in line with the ""Skill India"" and the ""Make in India"" initiatives, TKM Managing Director Masakazu Yoshimura said in a statement.

The company's operations in India are an integral part of its long-term global strategy, he added.

""As part of these efforts, Toyota Group in India is targeting to invest over ₹2,000 crore in India in the coming years on technology and electrification, both for the domestic and the exports market,"" Yoshimura noted.

The company reaffirms that it intends to make all efforts to promote and introduce newer, cleaner and world-class technologies and services in the market, he added.

TKM is a joint venture between the Japanese Toyota Motor Company and Kirloskar Group.

Workers make checks at a trim inspection line on the Innova Crysta compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) production line at the Toyota Kirloskar Motor plant in Bidadi, Karnataka. (Bloomberg)

On Tuesday, TKM Vice-Chairman and whole-time director Shekar Viswanathan in an interview said that the company would stop expanding in India ruling out future investments as the government keeps taxes on cars and motorbikes so high that companies find it difficult to build scale.

Later, the company's Vice Chairman Vikram Kirloskar refuted the comments and said TKM planned to invest over ₹2,000 crore in the country in the next 12 months.

Reacting to Kirloskar's tweet on investment, Union Heavy Industries Minister Prakash Javadekar had tweeted: ""The news that Toyota Company will stop investing in India is incorrect. @vikramkirloskar has clarified that Toyota will invest more than ₹2,000 crore in next 12 months"".

(Also read: We are committed to Indian market: Toyota after plans to halt India expansion)

Endorsing the minister's remark, Kirloskar tweeted: ""Absolutely! We are investing 2000 crore in electric components and technology for the domestic customer and export. We are committed to the future of India and will continue to put all effort in society, environment, skilling and technology.""

Before that, TKM had also issued a statement saying its priority would be to utilise its existing capacity in India which will take time.

The company has an installed capacity of 3.10 lakh units spread across two plants in Bidadi, near Bengaluru.

TKM rolls out Innova, Fortuner and Vellfire (imported as CBU) from the first plant, and Yaris and Camry Hybrid from its second facility.

172,GM faces unexpected bills as India-China tensions delay sale of plant: Sources,"Delays to General Motors' sale of its Indian plant to Great Wall Motor due to tensions between India and China are likely to result in hefty unplanned costs for the US automaker, people familiar with the matter said.

Gaining Indian government approval for China-related deals is now expected to take quite some time and although the sale should still happen at some point, GM has not changed its plan to begin winding down the plant's operations next month, they said.

""By next year, it will either be a closed GM site or it will be an operating site with Great Wall,"" said one source.

GM had planned to use the expected sale proceeds of $250 million-$300 million to pay off liabilities incurred with its exit from manufacturing in India in what a second source said would have been a ""no gain-no loss"" situation.

(Also read: GM to manufacture own 'family' of EV drive systems, motors)

Although money will come through once the deal is done, it will now have to pay out of pocket for severance pay, some of which would never have occurred had the deal proceeded smoothly, as well as other costs - which could amount to a couple hundred million dollars, according to the second source.

Sources also said severance pay costs could be much higher than usual due to lack of clarity about the deal's prospects and workers' demands for greater relief given the low chances of finding new jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The sources were not authorised to discuss the deal and spoke on condition of anonymity.

GM stopped selling in the world's second most populous nation at the end of 2017 after years of low sales but the factory continues to build vehicles for export. Located in the western state of Maharashtra, the plant employs about 4,000.

(Also read: General Motors, Honda seek alliance to share car platforms in this country)

If workers don't agree to the severance offered, GM will need local government clearance to lay off staff. That is often a long, bureaucratic process which could help stoke worker protests or political opposition, the sources said.

GM said in a statement it continues to work toward ending production at the plant and closing the deal with Great Wall. Great Wall did not respond to a request for comment.

ENSNARED IN TENSIONS

The sale was announced in January and had been slated to close in the second half of 2020. Just when it might proceed remains highly uncertain.

In April, India introduced stricter rules for investments from China and other neighbouring countries aimed at preventing pandemic-hit Indian companies being taken over at bargain prices. A number of central government ministries are now required to sign off on the deal, instead of just Maharashtra state.

Then in June, a deadly border clash between the two nations resulted in a further clampdown on Chinese businesses and Maharashtra put three investment proposals from Chinese companies, including Great Wall's, on hold.

(Also read: GM encouraged by global recovery, but no intent of 'short-term pop' for stock)

Further complicating matters, GM and Great Wall did not seek central government approval until late July, the sources said.

Investment proposals from Chinese companies are unlikely to be approved until tension at the border dissipates, two central government officials told Reuters.

India's finance and commerce ministries did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Great Wall ""now feels it is impossible to finish the transaction this year,"" a company source said.

The hold-up has made the Chinese automaker nervous as it had planned to launch its first India-made car in the first half of 2021, said a separate person aware of the plans.

The company, which plans to invest $1 billion in India, has started hiring staff, including executives to run the plant, and is in talks with auto parts suppliers, the person said.

But even after the central government greenlights the project, Great Wall will still need more than three months to finalise investment terms with Maharashtra state and to revamp the plant, the person added.

174,Daimler unveils Mercedes-Benz GenH2 fuel cell heavy-duty truck concept,"Daimler has presented the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck concept in a world premiere, marking the beginning of its hydrogen-based fuel-cell drive for the long-haul transport segment. The use of liquid instead of gaseous hydrogen enables the vehicle to perform just like a conventional diesel truck in terms of tractive power, range, and performance.

The GenH2 Truck has a range of up to 1,000 kilometers and more for flexible and demanding long-haul transport on a single tank of hydrogen. Customer trials of the concept GenH2 will begin in 2023 while its series production is slated to start in the second half of the decade. There is a need for zero-carbon goods vehicles on roads and hydrogen fuel cell trucks make a strong case here. ""There is huge potential inherent in hydrogen for the protection of our environment and a strong economy. That is why (Daimler has) been funding hydrogen as a transport fuel for over ten years,"" says Andreas Scheuer, Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.

The series-production version of the GenH2 will have a gross vehicle weight of 40 tons and a payload of 25 tons. Daimler says that two special liquid-hydrogen tanks with a storage capacity of 40 kg each and a powerful fuel-cell system will make this possible.

The GenH2 Truck has a range of up to 1,000 kilometers and more for flexible and demanding long-haul transport on a single tank of hydrogen.

Liquid hydrogen has a far higher energy density in relation to volume than gaseous hydrogen. This helps reduce the size of the carrier tanks, enabling the truck to have a larger cargo space. At the same time, more hydrogen can be carried, which significantly increases the trucks’ range, making it suitable for multi-day, long-haul transport where the daily energy throughput is high.

(Also read: Hyundai ships world's first fuel cell heavy-duty trucks for commercial use)

The GenH2 concept has also been equipped with a 300 kW fuel cell system and a 70 kWh capacity battery which can temporarily provide an additional 400 kW of power. Daimler says that the battery is not intended to meet energy needs but mainly to be switched on to provide situational power support for the fuel cell.

The pre-series version has two electric motors that are designed for a total of 2x230 kW continuous power and 2x330 kW maximum power. Torque is 2x1577 Nm and 2x2071 Nm respectively.

He has also in the past made a case for driving underground and his Boring Company is fast nearing completion on a tunnel project in Las Vegas which could cut down traffic times significantly. It is hardly surprising then that Musk has made a case for self-driving cars and tunnel transportation to come together in what he terms as a 'warp drive.'

Musk took to Twitter on Tuesday (US time) to inform that the tunnel project under Las Vegas is nearing completion. ""Tunnels under cities with self-driving electric cars will feel like warp drive. First operational tunnel under Vegas almost done,"" he wrote on his handle on the micro-blogging site.

The tweet once again set off a wave of excitement among many of the millions who follow Musk on Twitter. Among them are people who believe that tunnel road transportation could indeed solve most of the traffic woes that global cities currently face.

The Strip in Las Vegas, for instance, required a transportation solution because of the high volume of tourists it handles. Musk's Boring Company made a successful bid of $52.5 million to build a tunnel transport system which came to be known as the LVCC loop. The project was started in October of 2019 and is now nearing completion.

The twin 0.83-mile-long (1.33 kilometer), 14-foot-wide tunnels will cut down a travel time of 15 minutes to just under a minute. Musk has previously confirmed that the loop will make use of modified, on-rails electric sedans that will zip people at speeds of up to 150 mph (241 kmph).

Warp drive indeed!

Musk and Boring Company are reportedly eyeing more such projects which could ensure lightning quick transport solutions to cities currently grappling with choke points.

177,Toyota Yaris sets benchmark for small car safety with Euro NCAP's 5-star rating,"Euro NCAP has revealed the result of the first car to be rated against its revamped 2020 protocols. Toyota’s latest small family car, the Yaris, has passed the test with full five stars.

Toyota’s fourth-generation Yaris emerges with flying colours from Euro NCAP’s 2020 test programme. The car is the first to be subjected to an all-new frontal offset test, which replaces the one previously used since the programme started in 1997, and is the first to feature a counter-measure for injuries in far-side impacts. The mobile progressive deformable barrier (MPDB) test assesses the protection a car offers its occupants as well as the risks it poses to the car it has crashed into.





The Yaris, in general, does well, its small size and benign front end making it one of the less aggressive crash partners on the road. Two centre-mounted airbags inflate in side impacts to limit an occupants’ travel to the opposite side of the vehicle and to mitigate the risk of occupant to occupant contact. The Yaris also showcases the rapid advancements in crash avoidance technology: the latest generation of Toyota Safety Sense now can stop the vehicle during turning to avoid a crash with oncoming traffic.

Euro NCAP’s Secretary General, Michiel van Ratingen, said, ""Congratulations to Toyota on a top rating for the Yaris. This has been a tough year for all concerned and I am grateful to Euro NCAP’s labs and employees who have worked hard to deliver safety, while staying safe. We have had to adapt quickly to new working practices, and it is pleasing that the first car rated this year should have gone so far to address the safety issues that are emerging as top priorities.""

In addition to this new assessment, Audi's e-tron Sportback variant shares its stablemate’s 2019 five-star rating. And Renault’s hybrid variant of the Clio is also added to the list of 2019-rated vehicles, with similar performance to the combustion-engined car tested last year.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com

180,Watch: Ford Mustang slams into light pole while performing donut stunt,"Ford Mustangs have a history of crashing more regularly than most other pony cars. And it comes as no surprise that a Mustang slammed into a light pole while performing donuts in an open parking lot.

In a video posted on Facebook by a Mustang owner present in the parking area, a bright red Mustang GT driver can be seen spinning his pony car in tight circles with a seemingly good control on the vehicle. “Went out to one of my favourite parking garages for rollers and pictures... when all of the sudden a dude with a 5.0 shows up and starts doing donuts,"" wrote Brandon Calderon on his social media post.

While showing off his abilities to perform the stunt, the Mustang GT driver successfully threads together a couple of donuts. However, as ambition takes over, he eventually slams head on with a concrete light pole with a thud.

As clearly visible in the video, the hood of the Mustang GT was been bent upwards on impact and apparently the front bumper and headlights of the car have been damaged too. ""This is why Mustangs get a bad rep...,"" wrote Calderon.

It is not known if the driver performing the stunts faced any injuries or what was the cost involved in getting the Mustang repaired.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com
181,7 EVs in 7 years: Kia Motors teases its electric vehicle strategy for future,"Kia Motors is planning a global EV offensive in the coming years and has teased its strategy for electric vehicles. The South Korean carmaker has shared an early sketch of several of the brand’s future electric vehicles. Details of Kia’s future EV product strategy were announced by Kia President and CEO Ho Sung Song during an event at the brand’s Hwasung plant in Korea.

In an attempt to establish itself as a leader in the global EV market, Kia will launch a diverse range of dedicated electric vehicles and partner with EV charging companies worldwide to achieve this.

“Kia has sold more than 100,000 BEVs worldwide since the introduction of our first mass-produced BEV in 2011, the Kia Ray EV, "" said CEO Song. ""Since then, we have started to introduce a range of new BEVs for global markets and announced plans to accelerate this process in the years ahead. By refocusing our business on electrification, we are aiming for BEVs to account for 25 percent of our total worldwide sales by 2029.""

Under Kia’s ‘Plan S’ strategy, announced at the start of 2020, the brand plans to expand its BEV line-up to 11 models by 2025. Over the same period, Kia is aiming for BEVs to account for 20 percent of the brand’s total vehicle sales in advanced markets, including Korea, North America and Europe. Seven dedicated BEVs in the sketch revealed today will be launched by 2027.

The first of these BEVs, code-named CV, will be revealed in 2021 as the brand’s first dedicated BEV, destined for many regions globally. The new model will offer the same competitive product quality and eye-catching design as Kia’s other vehicles, with high-performance driving and recharging characteristics.

Earlier in January, Kia Motors unveiled its ‘Plan S’ mid- to long-term future strategy, outlining the brand’s plans to transition its future businesses to focus on BEVs and mobility solutions. Kia is focused on securing a global EV leadership position by launching dedicated BEV models and innovating in areas such as production, sales and services.

Kia Motors is undergoing a company-wide transformation in order to realise ‘Plan S’. The CV model, due to launch in 2021, will encapsulate the brand’s attitude towards innovation and change, presenting a new design direction that signifies Kia’s transition to an EV-focused business strategy. Kia's new design philosophy embraces progress, diversity and a rich composition of contrasting elements.

Kia is innovating its vehicle planning, development and production to actively reflect diverse customer needs from the product planning stage. Kia is planning to respond to market demands by offering diversified product types, with a range of models suitable for urban centres, long-range journeys, and performance driving. Furthermore, by adapting its new Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), Kia will be able to offer vehicles with best-in-class interior spaciousness.

Kia Soul EV is already a common sight in markets across the world and has won several accolades.

In addition, Kia Motors plans to expand its global after service infrastructure for EVs. Kia aims to increase its number of dedicated EV work bays in Korea to 1,200 by 2030. In other markets worldwide, Kia will increase its number of EV work bays to 600 by the end of this year, and more than 2,000 by 2023. Kia also plans to develop its own programs to train EV maintenance professionals.

Kia sees the expansion of electric charging infrastructures as a pre-condition for the popularisation of EVs and continues to explore activities worldwide to improve charging accessibility for drivers.

In Korea, Kia will strengthen business activities that directly lead to the construction of a charging infrastructure. Initially this will rely on its existing network of nationwide sales branches, dealerships and service centres, with Kia aiming to supply around 1,500 EV chargers by 2030. Furthermore, Hyundai Motor Group will install 120 Ultra-Fast Chargers by 2021 in urban centres and along twelve highways linking eight provinces across the country.

183,Study of cities reveals Delhi saved 3 days of commute time during Covid lockdown,"Indian cities are known for their massive traffic jams and crawling vehicular movement during peak hours. Little wonder then that while Covid-19 and the consequent lockdown caused numerous hardships, it also meant staying at home helped people save precious commute times. In a study of how much time commuters in global cities saved between March and July, New Delhi has come out on top with 79 hours that would have otherwise been spent in getting from one location to another.

The study was conducted by UK-based vehicle leasing company called Vanarama which made use of data from Inrix and TomTom, and then came out with the averages. New Delhi was found to benefit the most with a commuter saving three days of time between March and July because he/she didn't have to travel as before. A commuter in Paris was found to save around 69 hours while Brazil's Sao Paulo was third where a commuter saved 63 hours in the same time period.

In the United States, New Yorkers managed to save 58 hours while Los Angeles locals saved 58 hours which may have then be put to something more constructive or for relaxation rather than wasting in hectic commutes.

While not every country imposed a lockdown for five months, that is between March and July, but the Vanarama report seeks to average out the data to provide a perspective into the benefits of not commuting. Time saved was calculated based on annual average time spent by drivers in traffic by city in pre-Covid-19 times.

The same report also makes note of the improved air quality in cities like New Delhi, Sao Paulo and Beijing during lockdown periods when vehicular traffic was at a minimal.

The bad news, however, is that traffic levels in cities across the world are increasing - gradually in some, rapidly in others. Nonetheless, the benefits of reduced vehicular traffic has now been effectively underlined for cities grappling with congestion, pollution or both",https://auto.hindustantimes.com

Hyundai also revealed that the new i30 N will be the first Hyundai car in Europe to be available with an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (N DCT).

Hyundai Motor has unveiled the first information about the latest generation of its best-selling i30 N hot-hatch. In a series of images released, viewers can see that the new i30 N will have an updated design focused on dynamic performance and emotion.

The new Hyundai i30 N has new aggressive-looking front and rear bumpers, two large exhaust tailpipes, a wide N-signed centre grille, new taillights and new V-shaped LED daytime running lights.

The pictures also show the newly developed 19-inch forged alloy wheels, which are lighter than the wheels of the previous i30 N and contribute to reducing the weight of the car.

The new i30 N will be powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing up to 271 hp. The eight-speed dual-clutch transmission with several modes promises to make driving the new I30 N more enjoyable. It has an ‘N Grin Shift’ mode that increases peak torque through a turbocharger overboost setting. There is also a ‘N Power Shift’ mode which is used when the car accelerates with maximum throttle.

Hyundai has not released any official image of the interiors yet. However, on the inside, the new i30 N is likely to wear an all-black theme with a 7.0-inch digital display in the instrument cluster, a larger 10.25-inch widescreen infotainment system.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com
185,"U-Turn? Toyota says investing ₹ 2,000 crore on electrification of cars in India","Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice-Chairman Vikram Kirloskar on Tuesday confirmed that the company will invest over ₹2,000 crore in the next 12 months, refuting a statement by a senior company official that it would stop further expansion in India due to high taxes.

In a separate statement, the company had earlier said that its priority would be to utilise its existing capacity in India which will take time.

In an interview to Bloomberg, TKM Vice-Chairman and whole-time director Shekar Viswanathan had said the company would stop expanding in India ruling out future investments as the government keeps taxes on cars and motorbikes so high that companies find it difficult to build scale.

Reacting to the report Union Heavy Industries Minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted: ""The news that Toyota Company will stop investing in India is incorrect. @vikramkirloskar has clarified that Toyota will invest more than ₹2,000 crore in next 12 months"".

(Also read: Toyota, Maruti among many to highlight pain of high taxes in auto sector)

Endorsing the minister's remark, Kirloskar tweeted: ""Absolutely! We are investing 2000 crs in electric components and technology for the domestic customer and export. We are committed to the future of India and will continue to put all effort in society, environment, skilling and technology.""

Kirloskar also added that the company is seeing the demand increase and the market would recover slowly.

""The future of sustainable mobility is strong here in India and Toyota is proud to be part of this journey,"" he tweeted.

TKM rolls out Innova, Fortuner and Vellfire (imported as CBU) from the first plant, and Yaris and Camry Hybrid from its second facility.

The company has an installed capacity of 3.10 lakh units spread across two plants in Bidadi, near Bengaluru.

In the statement, the company said: ""Our first step is to ensure full capacity utilisation of what we have created and this will take time."" (Read statement here)

The automaker continues to be committed to the Indian market and its operations in the country is an integral part of Toyota's global strategy, it added.

""We need to protect the jobs we have created and we will do everything possible to achieve this. Over our two decades of operations in India, we have worked tirelessly to build a strong competitive local supplier eco-system and develop strong capable human resources,"" the automaker said.

In wake of the slowdown that has been exaggerated by the COVID-19 impact, the auto industry has been requesting the Government for support to sustain industry through a viable tax structure, TKM noted.

""We remain confident that the Government will do everything possible to support industry and employment. We recognise the strong proactive efforts being made by the government to support various sectors of the economy and appreciate the fact that it is open to examine this issue despite the current challenging revenue situation,"" it added.

The company's recent partnership with Suzuki in India on sharing technology and best practices are also in support of the “Make in India"" initiative and Indian government's policy, and aim to enhance the competitiveness of both companies, the company said.

TKM is a joint venture between Japanese Toyota Motor Company and Kirloskar Group.

In March 2018, Toyota Motor Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp had concluded a basic agreement for supplying hybrid and other vehicles to each other in the Indian market.

As part of the arrangement, TKM already sources Baleno from Maruti Suzuki India and sells it as Glanza after making certain changes in design and features.

It is also set to launch a compact SUV Urban Cruiser based in Maruti's Vitara Brezza.

186,"Nissan Z Proto showcased, gets retro styling and twin-turbocharged V-6 engine","Nissan on Wednesday revealed its much-talked about Z Proto which gives a glimpse into what the successor of the 370Z would be like once it does hit the production lines. While 'Proto' is short for prototype and this may mean that the car showcased may not be exactly the same as the one hitting markets, it still offers a scrumptious glimpse into its retro styling cues and the mechanicals at play.

The Z Proto is a preview for the upcoming Z35-generation 400Z and benefits from a straight yet stylish exterior profile with eye-shaped LED headlights, squar-ish grille and an elongated hood. The car is around five inches longer than the 370Z and while it does appear retro, Nissan head of design Alfonso Albaisa says that the Z Proto seeks more to pay homage to its predecessor(s).

(Also see more pics of Nissan Z Proto)

The emphasis is on giving the Nissan Z Proto a sporty and purposeful design language that pays homage to its predecessors.

There is nothing retro though about the carbon fiber elements at play all around the exteriors while the car sits on lightweight 19-inch alloys and the rear profile is dominated by two exhaust tips for that sporty appeal.

Step inside the Z Proto and be welcomed by a cabin that is every bit as modern as it can get. Multiple screens for a wide variety of controls, a three-spoke steering wheel with control buttons, seats of Alcantara and leather and with yellow stitching all come together to give the car a contemporary appeal. It may still be a two-seater but the occupants can expect a whole lot of gadgetry with a 12.3-inch instrument cluster and a nine-inch infotainment screen topping the list.

The cabin of Nissan Z Proto

What matters the most though is what's under the hood and the Z Proto doesn't disappoint. A twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 powers the vehicle and is mated to a six-speed manual which comes as standard. The production version may also get a seven-speed torque converter.

Unfortunately, there are some cards Nissan is still keeping close to its chest and the performance capabilities and figures of the Z Proto, therefore, have not yet been revealed.

Expect the production version of Nissan Z Proto to be revealed at some point in 2021 while select markets could get the car in 2022. As for pricing, many expect Nissan to price the production version at around $40,000 mark.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com

Thar 2020 brags of several highlights that seem to justify the hype it has managed to bask in. It will come in two engine options - 2.0-litre mStallion TGDi petrol engine and a 2.2-litre mHawk diesel engine, with option of six-speed torque converter automatic transmission and a six-speed manual transmission. There are also two variants - AX and LX, with the former oriented more towards adventure enthusiasts.

First launched here in 2010, the SUV has now been updated to offer much in the cabin too. A a seven-inch 'drizzle-resistant' infotainment screen offers phone connectivity options and puts out 'adventure statistics.' The speakers are mounted on the roof - unless one opts for the soft top or convertible top versions. The upholstery is completely washable while the rear seats are now forward facing. Even the switches on the dash can handle wet conditions while the vehicle itself boasts of 226 mm unladen ground clearance to help it negotiate water obstacles.

188,Tesla Model 3 breaks Guinness World Record as fastest charging electric vehicle,"Tesla has entered the Guinness Book of Records thanks to its popular Model 3 sedan. During a sponsored run by Zero Carbon World charity, a Tesla Model 3 recorded the fastest charging time for an electric vehicle.

Formula E racing driver from Mahindra Racing team Alexander Sims, along with Zero Carbon World’s Dean Fielding and EV specialist David Peilow recently took the Tesla Model 3 out on a run in UK to demonstrate improvements in EV charging infrastructure. They targeted to improve the previous record of 3 hours 44 minutes and 33 seconds taken by the previous record-holder in 2015.

Sims and his partners managed to completely thrash the record by spending a little over half an hour charging the vehicle while driving across the country. They trio stopped for just one hour 31 minutes and 32 seconds to replenish the Tesla Model 3 during the record-breaking run. They used a 150kW Tesla Supercharger station and three 350kW Ionity chargers during the 855-mile journey.

Made it at 22:16.



15h 46m overall.



1h 31m 32s of charging.



Old record well and truly smashed! pic.twitter.com/Z7GLrif1nz — Zero Carbon World (@ZeroCarbonWorld) September 12, 2020





Zero Carbon trustee Dean Fielding said, “Electric vehicles, charging capabilities and the charging infrastructure have come on in leaps and bounds over the past decade, and we want to bring attention to the fact that the UK is increasingly becoming EV-friendly and that making the switch to an EV is feasible, practical and enjoyable for both long and short journeys.""

Zero Carbon World has funded more than 700 EV charging points across the UK. The charity aims to reduce UK’s CO2 emissions, challenging misconceptions surrounding CO2 reduction, and encouraging sustainability.

Range and charging time are two of the biggest deal-breakers for people who want to buy electric vehicles around the world. Constantly improving technology, bigger and more powerful batteries and fast charging stations are increasingly reducing the anxieties among prospective buyers.

Yet, time taken to fully charge an electric vehicle through regular charging station still takes hours. However, things seem to have certainly improved in UK, where the government has upgraded the EV charging infrastructure.",https://auto.hindustantimes.com
189,Safety driver in fatal Arizona Uber self-driving car crash charged with homicide,"The back-up safety driver behind the wheel of a self-driving Uber Technologies test vehicle that struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in 2018 was charged with negligent homicide, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

Rafael Vasquez, age 46, who is also known as Rafaela, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday after being charged in the death of Elaine Herzberg on Aug. 27, court records show. She was released pending trial set for February 2021.

Herzberg died after she was struck while walking a bicycle across a street at night. The first recorded death involving a self-driving vehicle prompted significant safety concerns about the nascent autonomous vehicle industry.

(Also read: Should drinking alcohol be allowed in a car on autopilot? Social media divided)

Uber declined comment. A lawyer for Vasquez did not immediately respond to a request to comment.

A Tempe police report said Vasquez was repeatedly looking down instead of keeping her eyes on the road. Prosecutors in March 2019 said Uber was not criminally liable in the crash.

“Distracted driving is an issue of great importance in our community,"" said Maricopa County Attorney Allister Adel. ""When a driver gets behind the wheel of a car, they have a responsibility to control and operate that vehicle safely.""

Police said previously the crash was ""entirely avoidable"" and that Vasquez was streaming ""The Voice"" TV program at the time of the crash.

In November, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) faulted Vasquez's inactions and Uber for inadequate attention to safety and decisions in the company's autonomous vehicle development.

The NTSB said the probable cause was Vasquez's failure to monitor the driving environment “because she was visually distracted throughout the trip by her personal cell phone."" She was supposed to act in the event of an emergency.

Uber made a series of development decisions that contributed to the crash's cause, the NTSB said. The software in the modified Volvo XC90 did not properly identify Herzberg as a pedestrian and did not address ""operators’ automation complacency.""

Uber deactivated the automatic emergency braking systems in the Volvo XC90 vehicle and precluded the use of immediate emergency braking, relying instead on the back-up driver.

192,India’s fuel demand to contract 11.5% in 2020: Fitch Solutions,"business

Updated: Sep 19, 2020 15:27 IST

Fitch Solutions has revised downward its forecast for fuel demand contraction in India to 11.5 per cent in 2020 in line with further deterioration in the country’s economic outlook.

Its economists forecast India’s real GDP to contract by 8.6 per cent in the fiscal year 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021), down from -4.5 per cent previously.

“Demand weakness is spread across the board, with both consumer and industrial fuels set for the steep decline,” Fitch Solutions said in a note. “We have made a further downward revision to our India refined fuels demand forecast for 2020, from -9.4 per cent to -11.5 per cent, in line with further deterioration in the country’s economic outlook.” It forecast a 5 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in 2021 and 2022, as the outbreak is brought under control and the economic activity normalises.

In the first quarter of 2020-21, the GDP shrank by 23.9 per cent, the steepest contraction on record.

The domestic Covid-19 outbreak shows no signs of abating, with daily cases continuing to accelerate.

“While the nationwide lockdown (in place since March 25) was lifted on May 31, state-level restrictions remain in place and will likely drag on the economic recovery,” it said.

High unemployment and the loss of income stemming from the coronavirus have severely depressed consumer spending, which in turn will weigh on the business investment, it said.

In response to the pandemic, the government has introduced a number of stimulus measures which will likely continue to boost spending in the face of a persistent revenue shortfall.

“However, given the scale of the economic damage currently being wrought, the fiscal response is proving far from sufficient,” Fitch said.

Fitch Solutions said demand weakness is spread across the board, with both consumer and industrial fuels set for steep decline.

With a nationwide lockdown in place over March to May, domestic demand plummeted, reaching its nadir in April at 48.7 per cent year-on-year contraction for total fuels consumption.

As the lockdown was rolled back, demand began showing some signs of life, contracting by just 8.6 per cent in June. However, state-level restrictions, persistent disruption to economic activity and continued and aggressive spread of the virus dragged the demand lower once again, with 20.6 per cent contraction in August.

The transport sectors have suffered the heaviest losses, as social distancing measures cut off traffic and travel and curbed demand for road, air and shipping freight.

In percentage terms, jet fuel has seen the sharpest contraction, with consumption falling on average by 46.6 per cent in the eight months to August, it said adding at its April low, the demand contracted by 91.4 per cent y-o-y, due to a total ban on flights, excluding those for essential cargo movement, such as medicines.

Gasoline (petrol) demand fell by an average of 16.1 per cent in the YTD (with a low of 60.4 per cent) and diesel demand (which is widely used in the transport, industrial and power sectors) was down by 25 per cent, with a low of 55.5 per cent.

“Industrial demand as a whole has declined sharply, due to restrictions in place on business activities, labour and supply shortages and credit constraints,” Fitch said.

The one bright spot was LPG, demand for which rose by 4.3 per cent in the year to date (YTD).

“Social distancing measures have increased residential demand as whole, while the government’s policy to offer free cylinder refills to low-income households offered an additional boost,” it said.

Fitch said its 2021 and 2022 fuel demand forecast are skewed to the downside. “The economy was already under strain in advance of COVID-19. The virus has only served to exacerbate this strain and the path to recovery is far from clear. Both the manufacturing and services sectors will likely remain under pressure in the coming months, as demand remains weak and state-level restrictions constrain activity.” A rollback of these restrictions should help normalise output, but in light of the persistence of the outbreak, the return to normalcy will likely be slow, it said adding a favourable monsoon rainfall this season points to a strong harvest, while a recent sharp rebound in steel and cement output points to a nascent recovery in construction.

Both are positive for employment and income, particularly in rural areas.

201,Samsung to bring The Serif TV to India next week,"Samsung first introduced The Serif smart TV back in 2016. Then last year at CES 2019, the company introduced a new version of The Serif TV along with The Frame. Now, nearly a year later, the company is all set to bring 2019 Serif TV to India. The Serif TV range will be available in India next week at a starting price of ₹85,000.

To give you a quick brief about The Serif TV, this smart TV series has been designed by the French designer duo brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec and it comes with a 4K QLED display. It has a unique unibody design in the shape of the letter ""I"".

On the feature front, The Serif TV comes with an Ambient Mode that provides information, such as news headlines and weather updates, to the users. It comes with the ability to display imagery, and blend into any living space when the TV is turned off.

In addition to that, The Serif TV comes with the NFC technology that allows users to seamlessly connect to smartphones to stream music and other content by placing their smartphones on top of the TV. It is worth noting that this is the only TV that comes inbuilt with such technology.

The Serif also features support for AirPlay 2, which enables users to play videos and music, or share photos from their Apple devices to the TV. It will also allow users to take voice control one step further with voice assistants like Alexa and Bixby directly integrated into the TV.

Notably, the development comes nearly a week after Samsung launched a new range of the Frame TV 2020 and 10 new Smart TV models in India. The Frame 2020 TVs are available in three sizes in India. The 50-inch model costs ₹74,990, the 55-inch model costs ₹84,990, and the 65-inch model costs ₹1,39,990 in India.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/top-news

South Korea's Son Heung-min, whose place is theoretically in jeopardy with the arrival of Bale on a season-long loan from Real Madrid, scored four of the goals, with Harry Kane adding the other in a comprehensive victory after a shaky start.

The north London side fell behind at St Mary's to a Danny Ings goal in the first half with Southampton looking the more threatening side although Kane twice had the ball in the net only for both efforts to be ruled out for offside.

However, the course of the match changed on the stroke of halftime as Tanguy Ndombele produced a fine piece of skill before finding Kane, who helped the ball on for Son to shoot home into the far corner.

It was a finish worthy of Bale at his best and a precursor to more goals in the second half, only two minutes old when Kane dropped deep and found Son running through to score his second and to put Spurs ahead for the first time.

214,Matthew Wolff set to make golfing history as he seizes the lead at the US Open,"(CNN) Matthew Wolff can carve his name into golfing history on Sunday after the 21-year-old took the third round lead at the US Open after a brilliant five-under-par 65 at Winged Foot.

The American can become the first player to win the US Open on his debut in the major since amateur Francis Ouimet in 1913 and the first professional to achieve the feat.

He would also be the youngest US Open champion since the legendary Bobby Jones in 1923 and match the achievement of Jordan Spieth, who claimed the coveted crown as a 21-year-old in 2015.

Matthew Wolff of the United States reacts on the 18th green after completing a superb five-under 65 at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York to take the lead at the US Open.

Wolff finished in a share of fourth in last month's PGA Championship behind Collin Morikawa and is confident he can make the step up to claim his national Open after taking a two-shot lead on 205 - five-under-par overall.

""It's really early in my career, but I feel like I have the game to win,"" Wolff said. ""I feel like I'm ready to win out here and win a major.""

""Gareth sustained a knee injury whilst playing for Wales on international duty earlier this month and this together with La Liga's later start compared to the Premier League means he has had a limited pre-season.

""We currently anticipate that he will be match fit after October's international break.""

Tottenham's first game after the international break next month is away to Burnley on October 24 where Bale could don a Spurs jersey again.

Few gave the 21-year-old Pogacar hope of clawing back the 57-second lead Jumbo-Visma's Roglic held going into Saturday's 22.5 miles test, but he produced one the finest performances in the history of the Tour to win the stage and take the yellow jersey.

His victory on La Planche des Belles Filles was his third of the Tour and gives him not only the coveted yellow but also the King of the Mountains polka dots and the best young riders' white jerseys.

Team UAE Emirates rider Tadej Pogacar stormed up the final climb to La Planche des Belles Filles to win the 20th stage and take the lead in the Tour de France.

As Roglic faltered on the time trial's decisive climb, the UAE Team Emirates rider crossed the line in 55 minutes and 55 seconds, with a one minute and 21 second advantage over Roglic's teammate Tom Dumoulin and Australia's Richie Porte, who has moved into third place overall after his fine time trial performance.

217,Manchester United sunk by former player Wilfried Zaha in sorry start to EPL season,"(CNN) Manchester United made a sorry start to its English Premier League campaign on Saturday with a 3-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace as Wilfried Zaha scored twice against his former club.

Zaha converted a retaken second half penalty and sealed victory with a thumping shot past David De Gea as Palace made it two wins from two and repeated its victory of last season at Old Trafford.

Donny van de Beek's debut goal either side of Zaha's double after Andros Townsend opened the scoring for Palace in the first half was the only bright spot for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men, who finished last season with such a flourish to claim a Champions League spot.

Crystal Palace's Ivorian striker Wilfried Zaha celebrates scoring his side's third goal in the 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford.

There was little of that quality on evidence as United lost its EPL opener for the first time in six years, with a lack of pace in its defensive line evident as Townsend opened Palace's account as early as the seventh minute.

Jeffrey Schlupp was able to evade Victor Lindelof and crossed for Townsend to score at the far post.

Reed followed his first round 66 with a 70 for 136 -- four-under-par overall -- one clear of fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, who posted a fine second round 68, one of only three players to break par in Friday's second round.

First round leader Justin Thomas recovered from a poor start to lie one further shot back in a three-way tie for third, but his playing partner Woods struggled to a seven-over-par 77 to miss the weekend play.

After finishing 10-over-par for his two rounds, Woods revealed he would play just one more tournament before the defense of his Masters crown in November.

Like many others, Woods owed his high score to his failure to find the fairway off the tee, with the unforgiving rough at Winged Foot taking its toll.

Osaka, 22, had her left hamstring wrapped throughout the US Open. She previously told reporters she suffered the injury during the Western & Southern Open, which was held a week before the start of the US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

Osaka withdrew from the Western & Southern Open final, citing the hamstring injury, giving Victoria Azarenka the win via a walkover. Osaka rallied to defeat Azarenka 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the US Open final on Saturday.

With the win, Osaka, a former world No. 1, moved up six spots to No. 3 in the WTA rankings.

Duplantis, nicknamed ""Mondo"" and heralded as the next Usain Bolt for his potential to light up the sport, failed to best Sergey Bubka's previous world record of 6.14 meters (20 feet 1.7 inches) on his first attempt, but broke the 26-year-old record with a 6.15 meters (20 feet 2.1 inches) vault on his second.

The American-born son of a US pole vaulter has had an excellent year and remains unbeaten since the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha.

222,LeBron James sets records with 16th All-NBA team selection,"And on Wednesday, he broke yet another, becoming the player selected to the most All-NBA teams when it was announced he was selected to his 16th in his 17-year career.

The Los Angeles Lakers star moved past Hall of Famers Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most in league history.

James was named in the All-NBA first team alongside reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo, Houston Rockets guard James Harden, Dallas Maverick guard Luka Doncic and James' teammate Anthony Davis.

James and Davis chat during the second quarter of their playoff game against the Houston Rockets.

He also extended his own record for the most All-NBA first team selections by being named to his 13th All-NBA first team. He has been named in the second team twice and the third team once.

The 35-year-old made yet more history alongside teammate Davis as the eighth pair of teammates to each earn first-team honors during a season.

They're the first teammates to achieve the feat since Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire with the Phoenix Suns during the 2006-07 season.

James and Antetokounmpo both received All-NBA first team votes on all 100 ballots to finish with 500 points each.

Despite being one of the more senior players in the league, James is still playing at an extremely high level. He even seems to be evolving his game, leading the NBA in assists for the first time in his career.

With the help of Davis and James, the Lakers reached the Western Conference Finals and will face the Denver Nuggets.

The 16-time NBA champions last won the championship in 2010.

Doncic, 21, is the first player to be selected to the All-NBA first team in either his first or second season since Duncan in 1998-99.

223,NASA: How a set of athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics were immortalised on Voyager space mission,"‘Do not return without a victory!’

‘Do not return without a victory!’

As the golden disc team was hastily collating their picture album of humanity, they couldn’t escape the politics of the day; the late 1970s represented the mid-point of the Cold War. It is a testament to the integrity of their mission statement that these American scientists and researchers included such a prominent image of a Soviet icon, Borzov.

As he was making his final selections, Lomberg felt that the presence of Rigby and Borzov, an American and Soviet featured so prominently in adjacent images, provided an element of balance and fairness.

However, given how bitterly competitive the two programs were during the space race, he has often wondered if the Soviets would have extended America the same courtesy -- had the Golden Record been compiled behind The Iron Curtain.

To any alien life form in the distant future, such a detail will be utterly irrelevant but the gesture wasn’t lost on Borzov himself; he remembers how Communist Party members tried to motivate the Soviet team in 1972, saying “It’s a golden jubilee, 50 years since the formation of the Soviet Union! You’re going into the enemy’s lair! Do not return without a victory!”

He’d already traveled the world and explained, “We knew better than them how Americans actually behaved. I remember what was nice -- a hot dog and a glass of Coca-Cola. We didn’t need that kind of rhetoric instilled in us before our departure.”

“We knew better than them how Americans actually behaved. I remember what was nice -- a hot dog and a glass of Coca-Cola. We didn’t need that kind of rhetoric instilled in us before our departure.” Valeriy Borzov

Borzov was vaguely aware that his image was associated with the Voyager project, but only because some local journalists wrote about it several years later. And until CNN contacted him, he’d never seen the picture.

Surprisingly, he doesn’t particularly like it, exclaiming, “It’s not the best photo!”

“Firstly, the running position is not the best. The starting position is when the muscles are visible and there is a certain posture where you can see power and character -- this is some sort of frame between moments.” He went on, “I don’t like such photographs and this is one of the preliminary races, a work-in-progress, not the historical one. It’s not the final shot.”

Nonetheless, he has wondered why he was chosen. Without prompting, he volunteers that he ran as a clean athlete, without resorting to the doping techniques that marred much of the Soviet athletic program. “I wasn’t inflated,” he said, noting that you can tell the difference between “a running cockerel and a broiler chicken.”

Maybe he was chosen for his running style, which -- in his words -- could be described as “classic, light and with great power and intelligence.” Or maybe it was his all-around character, his “unification of power, sportiness, physical qualities, intellectual, psychological and other gentleman-like qualities.”

Borzov is now learning the truth about how and why he was sent to the stars and his reaction is humble and earthly: “To be told that you are flying outside of our civilization would be a kick to a sane person. But the most important thing is that it’s a compliment from the Americans. That deserves both praise and gratitude.”

“This is something that obviously really touched me, and this is something that cannot be measured.”

‘Blown away’

‘Blown away’

Of all the Voyager athletes, it’s clear that Rigby has the greatest understanding of the project; it’s something that she has spent a fair amount of time thinking about.

Like Roberts, she wishes that she’d been asked, but only so that she could have watched the launch and enjoyed it in the moment. “I would have said yes anyway,” she added quickly.

“I was blown away,” she said. “I don't often mention it and I don't know why I don't, because besides being born, having children and dying, it is the most profound thing I can imagine in a person's life because you get to be a representative of humanity.

“It’s like an adventure that you’ve been put on and you just go, ‘Wow, why me?’”

After retiring from her gymnastics career in 1972, Rigby has spent much of the rest of her life performing on stage. It’s somehow fitting that she became well known for playing Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie’s fictional character -- the boy who could fly amongst the stars.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

225,Indian Premier League: The once homeless street vendor set to make Rajasthan Royals debut,"(CNN) A typical young adult, donned in a pink and purple club jersey, with long limbs and a sprouting mustache, Yashasvi Jaiswal quickly runs his fingers through his hair. The words of wisdom that follow belie his 18 years.

The teenager has experienced more of life's ups and downs than many young men his age. His is certainly a rags to riches story fit for the silver screen.

Having left home aged eight to fulfill his dreams of becoming a professional cricket player in Mumbai, Jaiswal slept in a tent on a cricket ground while sustaining himself as a street vendor before his talent was finally spotted. Now, the teenager has secured a deal worth more than $300,000 with Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team Rajasthan Royals.

""Believe in yourself -- that's key,"" he tells CNN as he could be set to make his IPL debut. ""Work hard. When you leave the cricket ground and go home and sit on your bed, you should feel you've learned something.""

After delays and venue changes due to Covid-19, the forthcoming IPL season -- the richest club-based league in the world -- commences on Saturday in the United Arab Emirates, with eight teams, each named after cities in India, competing.

Zubin Bharucha, director of cricket for the Royals, first spotted Jaiswal at the team trials about three years ago.

""He walked across the stumps and flicked it over fine leg for four, and all of us just stopped, stared and wondered. There was something really special here,"" Bharucha tells CNN.

At the time, the inexperienced Jaiswal was not signed, but years later the franchise would come back for the left-handed batsman.

A young Jaiswal celebrates another fine innings

Dreaming big

Jasiwal was three years old when he was first handed a cricket bat by his father, Bhupendra Jaiswal, an amateur cricketer who was keen to encourage his son's passion for one of the country's most popular sports. Growing up, his hero was Sachin Tendulkar and, like the great batsman, Jaiswal wanted to play for Mumbai and, of course, his country.

Aged eight, he left the family home with his father for Mumbai, commonly referred to as the city of dreams, and initially the pair stayed in a relative's house.

""It's really difficult to live in a small house with six to seven people. It was hard to live with them,"" the young cricketer recalls.

As his father, an owner of a small paint shop in the village, didn't have the means to support his son financially in the city, Jaiswal soon realized he would have to work, and play cricket, to survive.

He left his uncle's home and moved into a dairy shop, working long hours there while also practicing cricket at a famous ground in South Mumbai -- a hub for aspiring cricketers. But, just as he was becoming accustomed to his new routine, he was told to leave the shop.

""I asked for time till the next morning. I had nowhere to go,"" says Jaiswal.

His coach provided the homeless Jaiswal with a place to stay for about three months before a tent at a cricket field with groundsmen became somewhere he would rest his head at night.

""I thought I had a great chance living near a cricket ground. I could practice more than anyone else,"" Jaiswal says.

Finally, the tide turns

Jaiswal with his coach Jwala Singh

Unwilling to tell his family about his daily struggles in case they would ask him to return to the village, sleeping hungry became the new reality.

""I slowly realized it was really hard to live there. There was no electricity, no water, no food. You had to make your own food. At that time, my parents couldn't afford much,"" he explains.

To make ends meet, Jaiswal started selling food as a street vendor and did so for three years until the tide turned.

In December 2013, a then 12-year-old Jaiswal was practicing in the nets when he was spotted by cricket coach, Jwala Singh.

""He was batting well against senior fast bowlers. His story was unique,"" Singh, who had also moved to Mumbai at a young age to pursue his cricketing dream, tells CNN.

A week later, Singh tested the boy's skills at his own cricket academy and the rest is history.

Not only did Singh take the boy under his wing, but he also provided him with accommodation. Jaiswal still lives with Singh's family.

With a roof over his head, and a professional coach to guide him, Jaiswal's focus turned only to the game. In 2015, under Singh's tutelage, Jaiswal participated in the Giles Shield cricket tournament -- an inter-school cricket tournament in Mumbai. It was in this series that he scored a triple century in a match and scalped 13 wickets. An all-round record in school cricket, his feat was captured in India's Limca Book of Records.

Coincidentally, it was on the same day that Jaiswal's father visited Mumbai to take him back to the village. Singh says the young cricketer's big score, and an assurance from him, altered the father's decision.

The moment of reckoning

India's Yashasvi Jaiswal celebrates after catching out Bangladesh's Shamim Hossain from a ball delivered by India's Sushant Mishra during the ICC Under-19 World Cup final in February.

Singh realized his student needed more than just routine practice on cricket grounds, so he would occasionally take Jaiswal to meet established cricketers, once meeting former Indian cricketer Wasim Jaffer.

""Jaffer told Yashasvi that making runs is a habit, playing longer innings is an art. That is what people will remember you for,"" Singh says, pointing out that Jaffer's insight is a key reason why Yashasvi has scored over 62 centuries to date.

Awards and praise followed. Jaiswal was selected for Mumbai's under-16 squad and then India Under-19s.

He made his debut in the 50-over format in September 2019 for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Jaiswal literally knocked the ball out of the stadium while playing against the team from Jharkhand state. The batsman scored 203 off 154, making him the youngest double centurion in the history of the 50-over game, List-A Cricket.

And then came another moment of reckoning. The boy who came to Mumbai with nothing but a big dream was selected in India's squad for the 2020 Under-19 World Cup.

Before he left for the much-anticipated series, the IPL auctions took place on December 19, 2019. Jaiswal was listed at a base price of $27,000 but was bought at 12 times the amount -- a staggering $327,000 - by the 2008 IPL champion.

""It was pretty normal since I had a good domestic season. My parents and sister were very excited. It was a good moment,"" he says of the price tag.

Jake Lush McCrum, the Royals' chief operating officer, vividly remembers the first time he met Jaiswal: ""I had been in India for a few months at that point and I was just taken aback to be honest ... He had such a challenging start, but what he's overcome is immense, and how humble he is.""

It's rare for a cricketer of Jasiwal's age to share a dressing room with cricket stars like England internationals, and Royals teammates, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes

This village boy's ultimate dream is to wear India's senior team cricket jersey someday.

""I just want to play cricket as much as I can. I really love it,"" he says.",https://edition.cnn.com/india
226,Borussia Dortmund: The Bundesliga football factory where superstars are made,"(CNN) There must be magic in the water at Borussia Dortmund .

The Bundesliga club has gained a reputation of finding and fostering world-class talent; taking young players with potential and developing them into world beaters.

Its record speaks for itself.

The likes of Christian Pulisic and Ousmane Dembélé have all, at different stages, walked through Dortmund's halls and gone on to play at the very highest level, making the club a handsome profit in return.

The current squad now boasts prodigious talents such as Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland who, already, are considered two of the best players in world football and who will, one day, demand eye-watering transfer fees.

But this isn't just a happy accident. It's a very deliberate strategy that has transformed Dortmund into real contenders -- both domestically and in the Champions League -- despite it not being able to compete financially with some of the continent's biggest teams.

The club's enviable philosophy was borne from its near bankruptcy in 2005, forcing it to do business differently to some of its wealthier rivals.

""I think we at Dortmund have a clear idea, a clear philosophy and we give these players experience and playing time,"" Lars Ricken, Dortmund's youth academy director, told CNN Sport.

""I think that is the difference to some other clubs and our unique characteristic. That is the reason why a lot of young promising players find their way to Dortmund.""

Jadon Sancho is one of the latest youngsters to appear in the first team.

Scouting network

Locating young players with the potential to become superstars is no mean feat and the club relies on its impressive scouting system to unearth the next big thing.

It's an operation run by Markus Pilawa, whose small team compile an in-depth analysis of every player they watch and speak regularly with the first-team management to confirm a player's suitability.

He's tasked with signing both established professionals and new talent in order to find the right balance in the squad.

""I think it's very, very important to have a good mix,"" he told CNN Sport, referring to the likes of Mats Hummels and Axel Witsel as the experienced heads in the current team.

""In recent years, we had maybe a squad that was too young. There were no leaders inside to lead the young guys. All of these guys here are top, top talented, but they are still still young.""

Now, because of the soaring prices demanded for the best footballers, Dortmund focuses much of its attention on young talent. The scouting process of which can start as young as 14.

Pilawa ideally monitors a youngster for up to two years before making a move, ensuring the player has the personality to cope with the club's huge demands.

""We are a Champions League club and we are competing with Bayern Munich, so we need a top level of talent and there are not that many guys on the planet,"" he said.

""Most of them are coming from abroad, so you need a big personality to come from your own country to a new club, a new language. It's very, very difficult.""

Amongst the current crop of young players making their way into the first team is Jude Bellingham, who the club had tried to sign last year.

The 17-year-old eventually joined from English side Birmingham for more than $30 million in July, disappointing a host of other European clubs desperate for the midfielder's signature.

Pilawa credits the club's track record for securing such a sought-after talent, especially when other teams can offer higher wages.

""We can show them we are not lying,"" he said, referencing the likes of Sancho and Pulisic who have successfully navigated the youth system.

""There are a lot of players and it's not 10 years ago or 15 years ago. It's last year, it's two years ago, three years ago. Every year we have the next one.

""We can show them that we have the experience. We know how it works and I think they are trusting us because we are not lying, we're not telling them fairy tales.""

Jude Bellingham is considered one of the brightest talents in world football.

The next big thing?

Whilst Bellingham has gone straight into the first team this season -- scoring in his debut on Monday -- there are also those graduating from the club's academy. Chief amongst them is US starlet Giovanni Reyna.

The American, whose mother and father both played international soccer for the US, joined Dortmund in 2019 from New York City's youth academy and is now making strides into the first team.

The club expects a lot from the creative midfielder who has benefited from the unique set up at the club.

In addition to high-quality training, a portion of Dortmund's success with young players is down to attention to detail.

The club's top young talents, identified by the team of coaches, regularly meet for one-on-one sessions which seek to help them both on and off the pitch.

Otto Addo, who played for Dortmund and the Ghanian national team before retiring in 2008, is often the man they meet.

He worked closely with Reyna as he made his way up to the first team, offering personal coaching on different parts of the game.

Working with three or four 'top talents' in every age group, Addo creates bespoke training sessions which cover four main topics; technique, tactics, physicality and mentality.

But it's not always the best players that end up meeting with Addo. Instead, it's those who show the most potential.

Addo says Reyna's potential was obvious to see from the very start and is excited to see him flourish at the highest level.

""He [Renya] was one of our top talents from under 17s and under 19s and I worked a lot with him. We trained extra and we also did video analysis after every match he had,"" he said.

""I could see Gio [Reyna] straight away. We have a lot of good technical players but it's his technique under pressure. To make no mistakes under pressure, to change direction under pressure and to accelerate in the midfield.

""He also has game intelligence, to position himself always between the lines, to read the game and he knows what's next. He brings a lot, way more than other players from his age group.""

Giovanni Reyna is expected to make an impact in the first team this season.

US market

It's no coincidence that two of Dortmund's latest talents to flourish have been American; Pulisic and Reyna.

The US, not yet known for its football culture, is somewhat of an untapped resource in the sport but Dortmund knows there is talent to be found.

For the last three years, Pilawa has worked to develop Dortmund's scouting network in the region and believes it can be a gold mine for clubs willing to work hard.

""It's a very important and interesting market for us. I know that there are not 10 top talents in every age group, but maybe there's one every three years and I have to know him,"" he said.

""I think the adaptation to Germany is not that big [...] everyone is speaking English here in the dressing room.

""It's not like maybe the French guys and Spanish guys who have some more problems to adapt because of the language.""

Youth coordinator Ricken is fully aware of the difficulties a young player might face when joining a new team and the club has methods of softening the move.

Players without English take up to four lessons a week to learn the language which helps them integrate with their new surroundings.

""It's not easy for them because they have new teammates, a new language and are away from the parents. They have to be very grown up at a young age. We feel a social responsibility for those young players,"" he said.

Christian Pulisic moved to Chelsea after making his name at Dortmund.

'A hard-worker region'

Searching for a player with the right mentality does not distract from the technical ability required to compete among Europe's elite.

Pace, technique and tactical awareness are all must-have attributes if you're going to play in front of Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, with a capacity of 80,000 raucous fans.

""I think that is one reason why the atmosphere in our stadium is so great, because there is a marvelous identification between fans and players,"" Ricken said.

""Our supporters want to see players from Dortmund, who were born in Dortmund or who have been educated in our youth department.""

The connection with the local community runs deep at Dortmund which, despite its global appeal, wants to continue representing the region it serves.

That begins with recruiting the right players who mirror the attitude of the city.

""Dortmund is a hard-worker region. A lot of people working hard and a lot of industry,"" Pilawa said.

""They love hungry people who are ready to fight until the end for their club. So this is a very, very important issue for me when I'm selecting players.

""Jude Bellingham is the perfect player for Borussia Dortmund, for example, because his mentality and his attitude on the pitch is the perfect one to connect the club with the fans and the fans with the club.

""I think it will get more important after this crisis [pandemic] because I think that the people in the stands are thinking more about football in general.

""Right now, you need the right guys on the pitch, with the right personality, showing 'I'm fighting for the club for you fans' because it's a very tough time for everyone here, especially in our region.""

Dortmund began the new season with a crushing 5-0 win over third-tier side Duisburg in the German Cup on Monday.

227,Fantasy Premier League: Magnus Carlsen has conquered chess. Now he sets his sights on fantasy football,"(CNN) Magnus Carlsen, the best chess player on the planet, should have been focusing on a match with the talented Chinese player Ding Liren in a renowned online tournament on a summery Sunday in July.

But, without any real reason being offered at the time, the tie was mysteriously played three hours earlier than initially scheduled. The world champion has now revealed why the chess24 Legends of Chess clash was moved: football, or, more specifically, fantasy football.

Carlsen, 29, a once-in-a-generation chess talent, is not just a football fan but was that day in the running to win the English Premier League's official fantasy sports game, Fantasy Premier League (FPL), on the final day of the season.

""My opponent was playing from China. So, basically, we rescheduled it for an earlier time for me and a more convenient time for him,"" he tells CNN Sport's Don Riddell.

""And the other thing is that the tournament we were playing was basically organized by my own company so if you can't use your power to do that, I don't know what that power is useful for.""

What began as a hobby -- a welcome distraction from the grueling demands of being a chess grandmaster -- has become an activity in which he now excels to a ludicrously impressive degree.

Carlsen competes against Daniil Dubov during the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in January, 2020.

Since first entering the season-long contest in 2015 -- a player assembles a 15-man squad from a budget of £100 million ($128m), with their footballers' performances on the field translating to points off it -- Carlsen has posted superb scores.

He finished 85,781 (out of many millions) in his debut season, rose to 2,397 in 2017/18 before dropping to 24,105 in 2019 (by his own high standards, just finishing inside the top 200,000 in the world in 2017 was nothing to write home about).

But it was this most recent FPL season where Carlsen picked up global coverage. Just before Christmas -- traditionally the time in actual football when the likeliest contenders for the title become tough to dislodge -- the Norwegian was in top spot in the fantasy version of the game.

He took to Twitter to point out that his ""bio needed an update"" with it now reading: ""World Chess Champion. The highest ranked chess player in the world. Former (live) #1 Fantasy Premier League player.""

Ultimately, Carlsen could not match the form of eventual champion Liverpool, which was top of the actual league by the second week of the season and would never be caught. But, then again, Jurgen Klopp's men only had 19 teams to worry about, whereas Carlsen was competing against 7.6 million others.

Carlsen speaks on his computer in the press room after he competes against Wesley So.

Come July 26, Carlsen -- fourth in the standings and 12 points behind the leader before the final matches kicked off -- had a decent shot of winning FPL. Ultimately, he could not overhaul his rivals and finished a respectable 10th.

""I think finishing top 10 is obviously a huge part due to luck,"" Carlsen modestly says. ""Of course, if you're playing well, you give yourself a much better chance of being lucky. For me, it's just an interest. I like watching the games, I like spending a little bit of time to consider what players I'm going to use ... I'm somebody who spends at least a little bit of time on it. I can think logically, and I've had a bit of luck. That's it.""

But ""that"" -- as anybody who has attempted to crack FPL can clearly attest -- is not merely ""it.""

FPL players are forever trying to land upon the best formations, balancing big names such as Mohamed Salah (at time of writing, the joint-most expensive player in the game at $15m) with hidden gems who can be purchased at a fraction of the cost but are regular starters for their clubs.

As Carlsen does not tend to discuss this aspect of his life too often, his perspective serves multiple purposes.

Asked about his formation of choice, Carlsen says: ""Usually in the past, I've been a believer of 3-4-3, but I think probably with all the options that are in midfield, you should play five midfielders. So either 5-4-1 or more probably 3-5-2.""

And what does he believe is the ratio is between strategy and pure luck? ""I don't think you can be lucky unless you have a basis of good strategy and tactics,"" Carlsen responds. ""I think that fantasy is quite similar to poker in that sense. There is a considerable amount of luck in there in the short term, but not so much in the long term.""

It is fascinating to hear Carlsen dismiss the notion that a chess, or fantasy football, player should be planning way in advance.

""Most of the time in chess, you'd only think a few moves ahead unless it's like a very, very small tree of variations,"" he explains. ""And, to some extent, the same applies in fantasy, that you should plan a little bit ahead, but you should always be very, very flexible when it comes to changing your plans, depending on the new data that that arrives.

""You can lay out a plan for the rest of the game, or in fantasy you can lay out a plan for 10 rounds to come. But the chances that you're going to have to change them significantly are very, very high. That's my strategy in everything: You come up with micro plans and then adjust to the new circumstances.""

Carlsen goes on to acknowledge that he is part of perhaps the smartest mini-league in the FPL universe, where entry is only granted to a select few grandmasters. ""Truth be told, there isn't much competition in the grandmaster league, so they really need to step it up,"" he says about his 12 rivals, with a twinkle in his eye.

As for what would be the more significant accolade, world chess champion or winning FPL, it is possibly the only instance over the course of the conversation that the grandmaster finds himself in check.

""In terms of the bigger achievement, of course, it's world champion in chess. But in terms of what I would appreciate more, that's a much more difficult question. But it's very difficult. So if people expect me to finish top 10 again, that's going to take an extraordinary amount of luck.""

228,German football team loses 37-0 after practicing social distancing,"(CNN) You know what they say, safety always comes first.

An amateur football team in Germany certainly doesn't need reminding of that as it suffered a crushing 37-0 defeat on Sunday after practicing social distancing in its game against local rival SV Holdenstedt II.

SG Ripdorf/Molzen , which plays in the 11th tier of German football, fielded just seven players over fears its opponent was a Covid-19 risk

Ripdorf co-chairman Patrick Ristow told CNN that Holdenstedt had come into contact with an infected player during its previous game and so Ripdorf felt the conditions were unsafe due to the two-week incubation period.

The club had attempted to postpone the game, Ristow said, but its opponents said there was no reason to do so as the team had later tested negative for the virus.

229,The 'greatest all-sport athlete' who helped revolutionize women's golf,"(CNN) In Beaumont, Texas, there is a small museum dedicated to a female double Olympic gold medalist and one of the greatest women golfers of all time.

On some days, though, there will only be a handful of guests visiting the facility dedicated to the ""greatest all-sport athlete of all time."" Even in her hometown, the name Babe Didrikson Zaharias isn't always widely known.

Zaharias, who was born in 1911 and named Mildred Ella Didrikson, not only helped transform golf from a predominantly amateur sport into a professional one, but also held multiple Olympic world records.

As well as being one of the 13 founding members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) in 1950, she went on to win 14 consecutive tournaments at the peak of her career.

Van Natta Jr. believes it is ""quite disappointing"" that Zaharias' name isn't better known given all she did for golf.

However, because of Zaharias' love of entertaining the gallery on the golf course with lewd jokes and colorful language, coupled with her refusal to conform to the traditional stereotypes of femininity of the time, she was a pariah amongst her fellow competitors and the subject of sexism and prejudice from the media.

""If somebody was looking at Babe and they were sexist or they didn't think that women belonged on a golf course or in a track and field event, she heard a lot of that,"" Don Van Natta Jr. -- author of ""Wonder Girl: The Magnificent Sporting Life of Babe Didrikson Zaharias"" -- told CNN Sport

""She was criticized for her look; she was criticized for not being ladylike enough. There were comments made in the press, that she should be home sitting by the phone, waiting for a suitor to call her as opposed to being out competing. It was very harsh, negative, critical things. And they hurt her deeply.""

Zaharias became a ""huge draw"" for golf crowds due to her energetic levels on the course, according to Van Natta Jr.

'American sports heroine'

The daughter of immigrants from Norway, sport always played a big part in Zaharias' life.

From baseball and basketball to track and field and tennis, Zaharias seemingly excelled at whichever sport she turned her hand to. She earned her nickname ""Babe"" as a result of her baseball ability and comparisons between her and Babe Ruth.

While she tried golf early on, a career in athletics was Zaharias' primary focus at a young age. Such was her dedication and cross-discipline ability at track and field, stories of Zaharias single-handedly beating entire teams became common across Texas.

The pinnacle of her athletic career coincided with the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, a time when athletes, unlike today, didn't always specialize in one sport, but often entered multiple disciplines in the hopes of achieving success.

Zaharias became a world record holders in the hurdles even before she started playing golf professionally.

Women, however, were unable to enter more than three events, so Zaharias participated in the javelin, high jump and 80m hurdles.

To this day, she is still the only track and field athlete, male or female, to win individual Olympic medals in running, throwing and jumping events. Zaharias won gold medals in both the hurdles and the javelin, and a silver medal for the high jump, but only after she was adjudged to have used an improper technique in a jump-off after tying with fellow American Jean Shiley.

Van Natta Jr. believes that Zaharias could have won more medals had she been allowed to compete in a greater number of events.

""I don't know about gold medals, but I think she could have medaled in probably at least five [sports],"" he said.

""She came in first place, just among obviously her American counterparts, at the event at Northwestern [University] that was the qualifying event for the Olympics, and she won five of those events. So I believe she could have been medaled in five (javelin, hurdles, high jump, 100m sprint and discus) easily if she had been allowed to.""

Zaharias throws the javelin to win the gold medal during the 1932 Olympic Games.

Beginnings

In the 1930s, it was difficult for women to earn any sort of living in athletics due to an almost total lack of prize money and sponsorship opportunities.

""Babe was very much thinking about a way to make a living as a sports woman,"" Van Natta Jr. said. ""And so she figured out that golf was one of the places that you could actually do it, even though a lot of the events were amateur events. But if you succeeded at them, she figured she could market herself and find some income that way.""

Zaharias took up golf with a ""competitiveness that was beyond fierce,"" Susan Cayleff -- who authored two books about Zaharias' life -- explained.

""She would drive golf balls until her palms bled and didn't set any kind of realistic limit on herself in terms of physical expectations,"" she said.

However, her previous success in other sports led the United States Golf Association (USGA) to bar Zaharias from playing in amateur women's tournaments, compelling her instead to play in professional men's PGA Tour events.

""They barred her in part because of a snob aspect,"" said Van Natta Jr. ""She was seen from the wrong side of the tracks, she was seen as a poor woman, she was coarse in the way she carried herself. She started defeating these wealthier women, well connected women to the USGA, so they knocked her out for a while.""

Zaharias practises on Pinehurst's golf links for the exhibition match in New York.

Standing out

Whilst playing one of these PGA Tour events, Zaharias was paired with George Zaharias, a famous wrestler from the time. The two married in 1938, with George becoming her promoter and manager.

With her husband's help, she became a ""huge draw for the crowds,"" Van Natta Jr. notes, with her ""chattering"" nature making her one of the sport's biggest draws.

She was said to have shown up at professional tournaments and announced to the media: ""The Babe is here! Who is going to finish second?"" as well as standing on the first tee before teeing off and announcing that she was going to ""loosen my girdle and let it fly.""

Babe Didrikson marries George Zaharias on December 23, 1938, in St. Louis.

However, her lack of femininity -- ""telling bawdy jokes and swearing, sometimes spitting, drinking,"" according to Cayleff -- and the perceived ""working class, gritty, sweaty"" nature of track and field competition put Zaharias at odds with her more traditional female competitors.

And because she stood out from the rest of the field and wasn't the most gracious of victors -- ""She would rub the people who she defeated, their noses in their defeat,"" Van Natta Jr. explained -- Zaharias consistently found herself on the receiving end of negative coverage from a predominantly male media.

Cayleff describes Zaharias as being a ""gender trickster"" as she behaved ""in ways that were absolutely contradictory to ideal femininity.""

But as a result, she was vilified in the press, with even her sexuality coming into question at times.

""They took her uniqueness and what I refer to as her gender outlaw status,"" Cayleff said. ""They take her behaviors and, particularly before she's married, absolutely craft her as a freak with newspaper headlines like: 'Mr., Miss or It?' or 'Which bathroom should Babe Didrikson use?'

""They feared or presumed she was lesbian and then a particular term was coined in reference to her. She was called a 'muscle moll' or a member of a third sex. People were baffled and troubled by her gender presentation and particularly women golfers who tended to be of a more upper-class background and fancied themselves refined; they demonized her.""

Zaharias drives off to the 15th tee during her semifinals match against Jean M. Donald at Gullane Links, Scotland in 1947.

Conforming

To counter the negative coverage, Zaharias recruited the help of Bertha Bowen, a Dallas socialite, who taught her how to ""apply makeup, how to wear a girdle and get her hair styled,"" Cayleff explains.

""She was the subject of absolutely vicious press after the 1932 Olympics where people were openly speculating and disparaging her sexuality and the like. And she understood, with the guidance of Bertha, that if she wanted to earn a living and keep her name in the public that she needed to seriously craft an image because who she legitimately was, was not someone that the American public was easy to embrace.""

Even so, Zaharias' competitive nature meant that she found it difficult to fully integrate into typical golfing society. This didn't stop her from becoming one of the most successful women golfers of the time, winning 41 professional tournaments in total.

And as one of the LPGA's 13 original members, she ""planned and organized the golf tournaments, drafted the by-laws, supervised membership, (and) set up the courses"" to help establish the professional women's game, the LGPA website explains

Zaharias urges the ball into the hole on the 18th green of Chicago's Tam O'Shanter Country Club in the Women's All-American Golf Tournament in 1950.

Although she did a lot for the sport for women, Cayleff contends that Zaharias was not a ""self-conscious role model or promoter of opportunity for women in sports.""

Cayleff recalls an incident she found while doing research for her book when Zaharias threatened to withdraw from a tournament going into the final round, despite leading by several shots, because, in her eyes, the prize money was not enough.

""Babe was out for Babe. In an instance like that, she was an absolute impact on increasing the purse in women's golf, but it was not for the betterment of the sport or the betterment of the female athletes in general. It was for Babe.

""It's a sort of mixed legacy. Yes, she absolutely impacted opportunities for athletes that came after her and athletes during her own lifetime, but she was in no way what we would call a feminist or gender conscious or concerned about equity in general,"" Cayleff said. ""She was concerned about a good payday for her and let the chips fall where they may be on that.""

Zaharias chips up to the green with a line of fans watching her.

Legacy

In 1953, Zaharias was diagnosed with colon cancer and, at the time , doctors were not even sure they could cure her. However, in 1954, she not only returned to playing the sport, but won the US Women's Open in Massachusetts, her 10th and final major, by a dozen strokes, while having a colostomy bag strapped to her side.

Zaharias chose to go public with her fight against cancer. This decision -- plus her remarkable comeback and her extensive work with the American Cancer Society -- helped change her perception in the eyes of both the public and the media, with Cayleff saying that it ""heroized her in some ways to a new generation.""

Didrikson (right) works out with the New York Rangers players Murray Murdock (center) and Andy Aitkenhead, goalie, in Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1933.

""She was honored by President Eisenhower for her work with the American Cancer Society and did considerable fundraising for cancer research,"" Cayleff said. ""The cancer work and the ability to come back and compete successfully was pretty much unheard of at that point. She was told she would never be able to compete again. And like she had done so many times in her life, she just tripled her efforts and determined she would prove them wrong.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
230,Phil Mickelson returns to scene of his most crushing defeat aiming for career grand slam at U.S. Open,"(CNN) Athletes often have favorite venues they associate with good memories and good performances. That, however, is certainly not the case with Phil Mickelson and New York's Winged Foot Golf Club .

Last time I was at Winged Foot, I was 36 years old with no accountability for my health. 😳 This was before @ForWellness . After becoming accountable for my own health, today I return to Winged Foot and let's just say I look a little ""different"" 😏 pic.twitter.com/SuYJFwnZdY

The course was the site of his most excruciating defeat when in 2006, needing just a par on the final hole -- or a bogey to take it to a playoff -- to claim his first U.S. Open title, the American hit the ball off a hospitality tent and made a double-bogey, handing the title to Geoff Ogilvy.

And while the crushing nature of that defeat didn't hold Mickelson back -- he went on to win two more majors -- the memories from Winged Foot will no doubt forever stick with him.

While the career grand slam still remains elusive to Mickelson as he returns to Winged Foot for the 120th U.S. Open Championship, which begins on Thursday, one thing that has changed is his body. He took to Twitter to show his transformation since 2006, admitting he looks a little ""different"" now.

""Last time I was at Winged Foot, I was 36 years old with no accountability for my health ... After becoming accountable for my own health, today I return to Winged Foot and let's just say I look a little 'different.'""

Mickelson waits to hit from the rough during the final round of the 2006 U.S. Open Championship.

A tough test

When Mickelson lost that heartbreaker at Winged Foot 14 years ago, the winning score was five over par. The score to make the cut that year was 13 over.

In contrast to the 13 under Gary Woodland shot in June last year to win the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, many are expecting another over-par score to win the championship in 2020.

The winning score has been over par in all but one U.S. Open at Winged Foot; Jack Nicklaus once described the course as getting ""tough on the first tee and never getting any easier.""

And after playing the course before the Tour Championship last week, Jon Rahm -- the world No.2 -- believes players will once again struggle to make birdies.

""It's just a difficult course. It's long. It's narrow. It's undulated,"" the Spaniard said . ""You just need to play really good golf.

""If it gets firm like some of the USGA guys (the tournament organizers) told me they want it to be, I don't see how any of us shoot under par. Or if we shoot under par, it would be somebody winning by a lot.""

Since golf returned from the coronavirus hiatus, Dustin Johnson has been in red-hot form.

In 10 PGA Tour events, the 36-year-old has won three and finished second twice -- including last month's PGA Championship -- and also won the season-ending FedEx Cup title.

As well as pocketing over $15 million for his FedEx Cup victory at East Lake, Atlanta and returning to world No.1, Johnson was named the PGA Tour's Player of the Year.

Entering the U.S. Open, Johnson is undeniably the man to beat, and he told the media that he was ""pleased"" with the way his game has been ""clicking"" in recent competitions.

""Obviously I've just put in a lot of good work. I feel like it's nice to see that the work you're putting in, to be able to take it on the golf course and to golf tournaments,"" he said

""I've spent a lot of time with (coach) Claude (Harmon III) and my brother working on the putting and everything just seems to be clicking right now. But I've definitely had to put in a lot of work to get to where I'm at. And obviously the game's good and it feels good.""

Johnson celebrates with the FedEx Cup trophy.

Creating better memories

In 2006, when the U.S. Open was last held at Winged Foot, Tiger Woods was competing just six weeks after the death of his father Earl.

And Woods admits that he wasn't in the right mindset to play well then, as he missed the cut by three shots. ""I was not prepared to play and still dealing with the death of my dad,"" he said on Tuesday.

""When I didn't win the Masters that year, that was really tough to take because that was the last event my dad was ever going to watch me play.

""He passed not too long after that, and quite frankly, when I got ready for this event, I didn't really put in the time. I didn't really put in the practice, and consequently missed the cut pretty easily.""

Woods hangs his head after hitting it into the rough on the 15th hole during the opening round of the 2006 U.S. Open.

Now the 44-year-old is back at Winged Foot hoping to create new, more positive memories as he aims to win his first U.S. Open title since 2008.

Since golf returned from the break, Woods has struggled for fitness and form, playing in just four PGA Tour events, his highest finish coming at the PGA Championship when he tied for 37th.

""This year I really haven't putted as well as I wanted to,"" Woods said, ""and the times I did make a few swing mistakes, I missed it in the wrong spots. Consequently, I just didn't have the right looks at it. I've compounded mistakes here and there that ended up not making me able to make pars or a birdie run, and consequently I haven't put myself in contention to win events.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
231,Mirim Lee wins first golf major with victory at the ANA Inspiration,"(CNN) South Korea's Mirim Lee held her nerve to win a tense three-way play-off and claim her first golf major at the ANA Inspiration .

The 29-year-old beat American Nelly Korda and Canada's Brooke Henderson with a birdie on the first play-off hole, after the trio had finished the fourth round tied on 15-under par.

Lee, who secured her spot in the play-off with an incredible chip-in eagle on the 18th, celebrated her victory by leaping into Poppie's Pond with her caddie Matt Gelczis, who performed a spectacular belly flop into the water.

""Usually I'm not afraid of water, but the pool looked a little deep,"" the world number 94 told the Golf Channel . ""So it's true that at that moment, I hesitated a little bit.""

Mirim Lee of South Korea poses with the ANA Inspiration trophy.

Lee's victory was her first LGPA Tour title since 2017 and the fourth of her career.

However, there was some controversy at the Mission Hills course after officials decided to build a structure between the 18th green and the lake in an attempt to replicate the stand that would normally hold fans.

It meant players could attack the green without the risk of the ball rolling into the water, instead getting a free drop if their shot hit the blue wall. Gelczis admitted this was their play.

Mirim Lee and caddie Matt Gelczis celebrate after taking the Poppie's Pond leap.

""Our play is to hit it into the middle of the green, let it run into the blue thing and get a free drop,"" he told Golf.com

""Without that being there we probably have to lay up because none of your long clubs are going to hold the green -- it's too firm.""",https://edition.cnn.com/china
232,Two-time golf major winner John Daly reveals bladder cancer diagnosis,"(CNN) Two-time golf major winner John Daly has revealed he's been diagnosed with bladder cancer.

The 54-year-old underwent a procedure to remove the cancer, but said there is a high probability of it returning.

""[The doctor] said there's an 85 percent chance it comes back,"" Daly told the Golf Channel . ""I've got to go back and see him in three months. They will probably have to cut it out again. It's probably going to come back, and then another three months that you don't know.

""Luckily for me they caught it early, but bladder cancer is something that I don't know all the details. But it doesn't look like it may go away. We will just see what happens. Maybe there's a miracle.""

Daly had been suffering with kidney stones and back pains recently and said these issues forced him to retire from the Charles Schwab Series last month and return to the doctor.

233,Neymar says he 'acted like a fool' in brawl but demands racism must stop,"(CNN) Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar says he was the target of a racist slur during the French champions' 1-0 defeat by Olympique Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday. The player at the center of the storm is Marseille's Álvaro González.

The 28-year-old was one of five players sent off during the match at PSG's home stadium, Parc des Princes, after a full-scale brawl broke out on the pitch in injury time.

The forward struck González on the back of the head and was shown a straight red card by the referee.

As he left the pitch, the forward is believed to be telling the fourth official about an alleged incident of racist abuse -- though he did not directly name the alleged Marseille player involved.

In a series of tweets following the match, the Brazilian wrote: ""The only regret I have is not hitting this idiot in the face.

""VAR catching my 'aggression' is easy ... now I want to see the image of the racist who called me a 'MONKEY SON OF A B*TCH.' I'd really like that! If I do a 'rainbow flick' you punish me. For a slap, I'm sent off. And them? So what?""

(VAR refers to ""Video Assistant Referee,"" the system in place to review incidents in matches once the referee has made his initial decision.)

PSG and Marseille players scuffle at the end of the Ligue 1 clash.

González himself took to Twitter, writing, ""There is no place for racism. A clean career and with many teammates and friends on a day-to-day basis. Sometimes you have to learn how to lose and accept it on the field. Incredible three points today, Allez l'OM thank you family.""

Neymar then replied to González's tweet, saying: ""You are not a man to take responsibility for your mistake. Losing is part of sport. Insulting and bringing racism into our lives, no I don't agree.

""I DON'T RESPECT YOU. YOU HAVE NO CHARACTER! Take responsibility for what you say. Be a MAN. RACIST!""

No place for racism

In post-match press conferences, both PSG manager Thomas Tuchel and Marseille manager André Villas-Boas stressed there was no place for racism in the game.

""Racism, in all societies, in football, in sport, in our lives, it can't exist, that's clear. But, honestly, I haven't heard anything like that today, nor has the referee, of course,"" said Tuchel.

According to Goal.com , who cited ""Telefoot,"" which is a French TV football show, Villas-Boas said: ""There is no place for racism in football. It's a serious fault if it happened but I don't think so. Before that, we had a situation with a spit from Di Maria.

""These are things to avoid in the world of football. I hope it won't be a black spot in this historic performance.""

CNN did not immediately hear back from González, Marseille and Ligue 1 when contacted for comment.

Later on Monday, Neymar, as well as the two clubs involved in the match, released statements.

After saying ""the guy was a fool,"" Neymar admitted in his post on Instagram -- where he never directly addressed González by name -- that he ""also acted like a fool for letting me get involved in that."" The Brazilian also pointed out that ""I wanted those in charge of the game (referees, assistants) to position themselves impartially and to understand that there is no longer such a place for a prejudiced attitude.""

Neymar (right) squares off with Dimitri Payet during Sunday's game.

The Brazilian noted: ""I thought I could not leave without doing something because I realized that those in charge would not do anything, did not notice or ignored the fact,"" before ending his statement with the words, ""you know what you said ... I know what I did. More love to the world ...""

Neymar's club PSG offered a statement of support for its player, ""who reported being subjected to racist abuse by an opposing player. The club restates that there is no place for racism in society, in football or in our lives and calls on everyone to speak out against all forms of racism throughout the world.""

Marseille named González in its statement but did not acknowledge the allegation of him making a racist remark, saying the Spanish defender was ""not racist, as he has shown through his daily behavior since joining the club, and as his teammates have already confirmed ...This controversy is serious and has already produced serious consequences. The club condemns the dissemination of the private telephone numbers of Alvaro Gonzalez and his relatives on Brazilian media and social networks overnight, giving rise to constant harassment -- including death threats.""

As for the match itself on Sunday, Florian Thauvin scored the game's only goal when he converted Dimitri Payet's long free kick into the PSG box in the first half.

The heated affair ended with 14 cards being shown -- five of which were red -- as Marseille won at the Parc des Princes for the first time since February 2010.

Villas-Boas, meanwhile, added on the incident: ""Neymar was a little bit annoyed with this situation, I hope there is nothing, I hope it won't put darkness on this victory [...] Alvaro is an experienced player. Obviously, there is no room for racism in football, but I don't think that was the case.""

As well as Neymar, PSG's Layvin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes and Marseille's Jordan Amavi and Darío Benedetto were all dismissed as a result of the brawl in the game's closing stages.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
234,Why American billionaire Joseph DaGrosa thinks now is the right time to invest in European football,"(CNN) With certain revenue streams dried up, football clubs, like many other sports franchises around the world, have been forced to take a financial hit amid the coronavirus pandemic .

As seasons resume across Europe, matchday revenues remain on hold as fans are kept away from stadiums, and in the Premier League , Deloitte estimates that rebates on broadcast and commercial deals -- together with the lack of ticketing revenues -- will result in a permanent loss of almost $650 million (£500 million) for clubs.

The situation is not just unique to the UK. Barcelona's president Josep Maria Bartomeu said last month that the club has lost €200 million ($236 million) since March.

Yet one billionaire believes now is the perfect time to invest in the European game.

American investor Joseph DaGrosa Jr., chairman of Kapital Football Group (KFG), has already started ownership discussions with two Premier League clubs -- although confidentiality agreements mean he can't disclose who -- and is poised to advance his plans with ownership platform KFG.

He calls the Premier League the ""granddaddy of them all"" when it comes to investing in football -- ""the league that people around the world look to for quality of play and that has the best recognition.""

DaGrosa is seen ahead of the Bordeaux's Ligue 1 match against Paris Saint-Germain.

Similar to Manchester City and City Football Group , KFG hopes to build a portfolio of clubs around the world, centered on an anchor club in one of Europe's top leagues.

""We're not overly concerned if a club is losing money, particularly in the Covid-19 environment,"" DaGrosa tells CNN Sport.

""We understand the world has changed but we want to make sure that the club is positioned for on-field success which will ultimately lead to financial success.

""We want to make sure that the management on the sporting side is strong -- which includes not just the manager, but also scouting -- and that the infrastructure's strong.

""We're looking for clubs with good academies to develop local talent.""

A good time to buy

DaGrosa led a takeover of French club Bordeaux in 2018, the second American businessman to invest in French football, but sold out last year.

He was also close to purchasing Premier League side Newcastle United last December before discussions with current owner Mike Ashley broke down.

Now, however, he believes the Covid-19 pandemic has presented a unique opportunity, particularly when it comes to signing players.

""I think there's opportunity to buy clubs at lower prices than just a few months ago, but more importantly, there's an opportunity to acquire players, at least for the next couple of transfer market windows, at pretty material discounts because clubs need cash,"" explains DaGrosa.

DaGrosa became owner of Bordeaux in 2018.

""Just about every club out there with very few exceptions are looking for ways to shore up their finances and the easiest way to do that is to sell players.

""Everyone's mindful of a need to not get relegated and so forth but I think a lot of clubs are faced with a very tough choice in terms of staying up in the table and generating cash through the sale of players and I think a lot of them are forced to sell players that they otherwise might want to keep.

""I think it's a very good time if you can play offense in this transfer market window and be on the buying side; I think it's a particularly good time to be on the buying side.""

Diversifying revenue

City Football Group (CFG), which is owned by Abu Dhabi United Group and Emirati royal Sheikh Mansour, has emerged as a lucrative ownership model over the past decade.

Since the Abu Dhabi owners purchased Manchester City in 2008, the group has gone on to buy other clubs around the world, including in the United States, Australia, Japan, Uruguay, Spain and India.

The China Media Capital consortium bought a 13% stake of CFG for $400 million in December 2015, while US private equity giant Silver Lake acquired just over 10% of CFG for $500 million last year.

""The whole idea behind multiple club ownership is diversification of revenue streams and profits and synergies across the platform,"" says DaGrosa.

""I think (CFG) has been very successful in creating that platform. It's taken them quite some time to do that, and that's not a criticism, that's just how their plan has played out, a steady plan to grow over time.

""Our plan is, in this environment, we think there's unique opportunities that have opened up to us that otherwise didn't exist for CFG in the past.

""We want to capitalise on it, both in terms of speed of execution as well as ultimately what we're paying for the clubs relative to what they may have paid.""

Club caretakers

DaGrosa's time at Bordeaux may not have gone smoothly as far as results were concerned -- the club finished 14th in Ligue 1 in the 2018/19 season, its lowest placing in 14 years -- but he nevertheless sees the experience as a learning curve.

""As an American I had a newfound appreciation for the real passion for the sport in Europe and more particularly for the passion within a particular city,"" he says.

It also reinforced his opinion that ownership is not necessarily about rewriting a club's history books.

""As owners we're just part of that club's and that city's long-term history and at the end of the day we're just a small part of it in the grand scheme of things,"" DaGrosa adds.

""As I always said in Bordeaux, the club's been around 139 years, we were only part of that for just over a year.

""But had we been part of that for five years, 10 years or 15 years, it's still nothing more than a piece of the continuum of the life of the club.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
235,Jawahir Roble: The trailblazing referee told that football 'is a man's game',"(CNN) Football has never been just a hobby for Jawahir Roble; it's her passion.

Born in Somalia, the 25-year-old grew up playing football with friends. They would spend almost every waking minute kicking a ball around the beaches until their parents called them in for dinner.

She loved it. She loved her ""beautiful"" country. But civil war changed all that.

Somalia was plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991. Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking mayhem nationwide.

No longer safe in their own home, Roble's family fled to England when she was just 10 years old.

She still remembers the journey and her parents telling her not to speak to anyone until they got to the airport.

""I never, ever, in a million years, dreamed of leaving Somalia,"" she told CNN Sport.

""We struggled a lot as a family because imagine [...] nobody speaks English in a whole new country. Who is going to fill out the papers? It was difficult.""

Jawahir Roble has featured in a recent UEFA iniative.

Refuge in the UK

The one positive for the family was their eventual location -- a house in the shadows of England's home of football, Wembley Stadium.

Substituting the beaches of Somalia for a garden in London wasn't always the easiest transition but as long as a football was at her feet, Roble and her siblings were happy.

""I think football was a little escape route for us because we would bring a football into school and we'd just play and play and play with the school kids,"" she said, smiling.

""That way we got to learn English quicker and we made a lot of friends.""

Despite her parents both being football fans, neither were particularly comfortable with their daughter pursuing any career in the sport over her academic studies.

It led Roble to practice in secret, quickly changing out of her football gear whenever she returned home from playing with her friends.

""I really wanted to make my parents proud but me playing sports was not the way,"" said Roble, who is now the focus of a UEFA 'We Play Strong' mini documentary.

""But I was like 'I come first.' I need to make myself happy, I need to make my dreams come true and hopefully one day they will accept me for who I am. Sports is a big thing.

""I don't blame them [her parents]. It's their generation, it's their mindset. I'm glad that now we're all on the same page.""

'You have to be super strong'

After dropping out of university while studying IT, Roble returned to study Football Coaching and Management. From there, she volunteered at a local club and, by chance, was asked to referee a small game out of necessity. She's never looked back.

She now referees both men and women up to five times a day in the lower ranks of English football and has became the UK's first Muslim female referee.

""I don't see myself as a Muslim girl or a female, I just see myself someone who actually loves football and OK, the image is there, but it's what's inside,"" she said.

""In that 90 minutes, whether I'm playing or refereeing, nothing else matters around me. It's just the best feeling ever. I'm not thinking about school. I'm not thinking about anything. It's just pure pleasure. Literally, I love it.""

The 25-year-old now has dreams of refereeing some of the world's most prestigious leagues and tournaments and, after barely 30 minutes in her company, you wouldn't bet against it.

Referee Sam Allison will become the first black referee to officiate in English football's top four divisions since 2009 next season and will become the first non-white official in the English Football League since 2010.

Whilst creating her own path, Roble has learned to deal with the verbal backchat that's an almost constant feature of a referee's game and is more than comfortable when putting people ""in their place.""

She's been told on a number of occasions that ""this is a man's game, ref.""

""You have to be super, super strong. Literally, all your bossiness has to come out,"" she said, remembering an incident when a player told her she wouldn't be safe walking home after she had given a decision.

""All your resilience has to come out. You can't just be a softy when you're a referee because people will have a go at you, players will have a go at you, so you have to look after yourself.""

Message for the world

Having proved her parents and wider community wrong, Roble wants to be a role model for other young children with ambitions for a career in the game.

She also wants people to understand the plight of refugees across the world, especially during such uncertain times.

""It's an horrendous time right now, people are being discriminated for who they are,"" she said.

""A lot of refugees are going to different countries. These refugees, these people are asking for help. If their home countries were not a problem for them, they would not be going to other people's homes.

""I would say respect them, support people as much as you can and just be there for them because, me being in England, I've been looked after very well. I'd actually call this place a second home. I'm very grateful.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
236,These were the Black victims Naomi Osaka honored on face masks at the US Open,"(CNN) She said earlier this year that she was ""done being shy,"" and tennis star Naomi Osaka duly found her voice at the 2020 US Open.

Osaka, 22, won the tournament on Saturday by coming from behind to beat Belarusian Victoria Azarenka in a thrilling three-set final

Having produced some of the best tennis of her young career on the court to seal her third grand slam title, off it Osaka also made a statement at this year's tournament.

In each of her seven matches, she wore a face covering displaying the name of a different Black victim of alleged police or racist violence in the US -- from Breonna Taylor in her first round-match against Misaki Doi to Tamir Rice in the final against Azarenka.

""I feel like the point is to make people start talking,"" Osaka said.

Breonna Taylor

Osaka wears a mask in honor of Breonna Taylor before her first-round match against Misaki Doi.

Taylor , an EMT and aspiring nurse, was killed in her own home in March. Three plainclothes Louisville police officers executing a ""no-knock"" warrant returned gunfire after Taylor's boyfriend had fired a warning shot because he thought he was shooting at intruders.

After wearing Taylor's name, Osaka revealed she had seven masks to wear throughout the tournament and had started with Taylor's name ""because she was most important.""

She told reporters: ""I'm aware that tennis is watched all over the world, and maybe there is someone that doesn't know Breonna Taylor's story. Maybe they'll like Google it or something.

""For me, just spreading awareness. I feel like the more people know the story, then the more interesting or interested they'll become in it.""

Elijah McClain

Osaka arrives on court with Elijah McClain's name on a face mask.

McClain , a 23-year-old massage therapist, was stopped by three officers in the Denver suburb of Aurora last August as he was walking home from a convenience store with an iced tea.

McClain was placed in a carotid hold, which restricts blood flow to the brain, the Adams County District Attorney said. A police news release had said McClain had ""resisted contact"" with officers before a struggle ensued. The DA's letter said paramedics arrived at the scene and administered ketamine, a powerful anesthetic. Three days later McClain was declared brain dead.

""For me, I think when I heard about (McClain's) story it was very hurtful,"" Osaka said following her second-round victory against Camila Giorgi.

""No one can really paint the narrative that he was a bad guy because they had so many stories and so many warm-hearted things to say about him.""

Ahmaud Arbery

Osaka displays Ahmaud Arbery's name at the US Open.

Osaka wore Arbery's name on her face mask as she walked out for her third-round match against Marta Kostyuk.

Arbery , a 25-year-old unarmed Black man, died after he was chased by two White men while jogging in Brunswick, Georgia. Arbery and one of the men, Travis McMichael, struggled over the latter's shotgun and Arbery was shot three times, authorities said.

The pair face murder charges, along with another man who filmed the incident. All three pleaded not guilty in July.

Osaka told reporters after the game that she had been ""touched"" by the response she had so far received for wearing the masks during her US Open campaign.

Trayvon Martin

Osaka walks out wearing a mask with Martin's name before taking on Anett Kontaveit.

The world No. 9 was almost moved to tears after she was shown messages from the families of Arbery and Trayvon Martin , a 17-year-old who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012 as he walked home from a convenience store carrying iced tea and Skittles.

""I'm not sure what I would be able to do if I was in their position,"" said Osaka, who displayed Martin's name following her win against Anett Kontaveit.

""I feel like I'm a vessel at this point in order to spread awareness and it's not going to dull the pain, but hopefully I can help with anything that they need.""

George Floyd

Osaka wears a face mask bearing Floyd's name before her match against Shelby Rogers.

The death of Floyd , the fifth name Osaka wore as she contested her third grand slam quarterfinal, sparked protests across the United States and worldwide.

Floyd, an unarmed Black man, died in Minneapolis after an officer, who was called because a store owner believed Floyd had used a counterfeit bill to pay, pinned him to the ground by kneeling on his neck for several minutes.

Philando Castile

Osaka arrives for her semifinal against Jennifer Brady.

Castile was fatally shot in July 2016 by Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop.

Yanez was later found not guilty of second-degree manslaughter and also acquitted of two counts of intentional discharge of a firearm that endangers safety.

Castile's death gained widespread attention after his girlfriend broadcast the shooting's aftermath on Facebook Live.

Tamir Rice

Naomi Osaka, 22, wears a mask bearing the name of Tamir Rice as she walks on court for the final of the US Open on September 12, 2020.

Rice , a 12-year-old boy, was killed by police gunfire in Cleveland, Ohio in November 2014 while he was holding a toy replica pistol.

Video footage showed Timothy Loehmann, who was then a trainee, arriving in a squad car that was driven by officer Frank Garmback. The car moved close to Rice and less than two seconds later, Loehmann shot the boy.

The two officers both said in written statements in 2015 they thought Rice was pulling out a real gun from his waistband. A grand jury declined to indict either of the officers.

In 2016, the city of Cleveland said it would pay $6 million to settle a federal lawsuit filed by Rice's family.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
237,Novak Djokovic doesn't think he'll 'ever forget' disqualification from US Open,"(CNN) Novak Djokovic says his disqualification from the US Open has been a ""big lesson"" but admits he doesn't think he will ""ever forget about it.""

Djokovic apologized for the incident -- in which he took a ball from his pocket and hit it behind him only for it to strike the judge in the throat -- on social media afterward.

The world No.1, who says he's checked on the judge, Laura Clark, to make sure she's OK, spoke for the first time since the incident, explaining he was ""shaken by the whole thing.""

""Of course, it was very hard for me to accept right after it happened. For a couple of days, I was in shock and I was shaken by the whole thing,"" Djokovic said at a news conference in Rome

""There was a lot of speculation about whether it was deserved. I accepted it, I moved on. I checked on Laura after the match, she said that she was fine. I felt really sorry to cause the shock and drama to her because she didn't deserve that in any way.

""I felt very good about myself, my game. It was totally unexpected and very unintended but, when you hit the ball like that, you have a chance to hit somebody that is on the court. I accepted it and I had to move on. Of course, I didn't forget about it, I don't think I'll ever forget about it.""

Djokovic tends to the judge after striking her with a ball.

'I'm hoping for the best'

Even before the incident for which he was disqualified, Djokovic's aggression had shone through. He had whacked a ball angrily against the advertising hoardings earlier in the same match.

But while he acknowledges he is working to be ""the best version of myself on the court and off the court,"" his fiery temperament is something that has helped the 17-time grand slam winner reach the top of the sport.

""I understand that I have outbursts and this is the personality and the player I have always been,"" he said. ""I obviously went through ups and downs in my career in managing to control my emotions more or less but you're alone out there, it's a lot of intensity, a lot of pressure and you have to deal with all of that so sometimes situations like this happen.

Djokovic tends to the line judge who was hit with the ball.

""I cannot promise that I will never, ever do anything similar to that. I'm definitely going to try my best that something like that never happens again, obviously, but anything is possible in life. I'm going to take this in as profound as possible as a big lesson.""

Djokovic is preparing to appear at this week's Italian Open and the French Open, which begins on September 27. And getting back onto the court was important for him in getting over the incident.

""I don't think I'll have any major issues coming back to the tour and being able to perform well. I have my first chance here in Rome.

""It's great I think I have a tournament a week or 10 days after it happened because I feel the earlier, I get back in competition mode the faster I'll overcome the memory and re-program it. I'm hoping for the best.""

Djokovic returns a forehand during a practice session in Rome, Italy.

Rafael Nadal, who chose not to defend US Open title in New York, will play his first tournament since the end of February in Rome.

He said of Djokovic's incident: ""The consequences have been always the same. Novak was unlucky. The rules say clearly that's a default.

""Sorry for him. He had an opportunity there. But in some way you should not be doing this. It is important to have the right self-control on the court because, if not, you can be unlucky as he was.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
238,Dominic Thiem dedicates US Open win to family after 'so many sacrifices',"(CNN) Newly-crowned grand slam champion Dominic Thiem has dedicated his US Open triumph to his family for making ""so many sacrifices"" over the years in support of his career.

The Austrian, 27, came from two sets down against good friend Alex Zverev in a brutal, nerve-shredding four-hour marathon to finally win the first major of his career -- after having previously fallen three times at the final hurdle -- and make history.

Thiem is part of the younger generation of players from whom much was expected but had been unable to dethrone the aging trio of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. But, finally, tennis has a new men's grand slam champion -- and the first born in the 1990s.

The new US Open champion also etched his name into the record books by becoming the first player in the Open Era, which began in 1968, to rally from two sets down and win a final at Flushing Meadows

With Federer and Nadal not traveling to New York, and Djokovic suffering an ignominious disqualification in the fourth round for hitting a line judge with a ball, a golden opportunity was presented to the tournament's remaining players to become the first new men's grand slam champion for six years.

Eventually, amid all the headlines about players who weren't at the US Open, Thiem was the one able to hold his nerve.

""I cannot realize it yet, but it's definitely the biggest goal in tennis what I achieved, winning a slam title,"" he told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell. ""There is nothing better than that and all the hard work paid off and also all the hard work of my family, of my team.

""They made so many sacrifices. They drove hundreds of thousands of kilometers with the car to bring me to practice and I think today's also the day where I gave back a lot.

""It's a huge day for me, but also for everybody who was involved basically since the beginning of my life to get to moments like this.""

Thiem and Zverev meet at the net following the Austrian's victory.

Given the absence of the 'Big Three' from the latter stages of this tournament, questions will continue to be asked of the younger generation of players -- known as the 'NextGen' -- until they start to win major tournaments regularly.

However, Thiem says the absence of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic only exacerbated the pressure of winning a first grand slam, rather than alleviate it.

""Nobody really from us players talked about it,"" Thiem, the son of tennis coaches, said. ""It was somewhere in the back of our heads when the moment arrived, when Novak was out, because, of course, it increased the chances of the eight remaining players.

""But it also but also put a huge amount of pressure on each of us because the chance to win this title was a little bit higher than to win the title if the 'Big Three' are around.

""Everybody knew that and that was not easy. Well, the next slam [French Open] is just around the corner and two of the big three are back there again, but I guess that Sasha, me and three or four other guys are really almost with them from the level and it's going to be interesting how it develops.""

Dominic Thiem slumps to the floor after the winning point.

With 16 career titles to his name prior to the US Open and a career-high ranking of No. 3, Thiem was widely considered the most likely of the NextGen stars to win a grand slam title.

The 27-year-old has reached two of his three grand slam finals since welcoming former professional Nicolas Massu, the only man in the modern era to win gold in singles and doubles at the same Olympics, onto his coaching team at the start of last year and has enjoyed a stark improvement to his game.

But following defeats in all three -- at the 2018 and 2019 French Open finals and the Australian Open final at the beginning of this year -- Thiem admits that doubts about whether he'd ever win a grand slam started creeping into his mind.

""There are always doubts after every single final, after every of these three finals are lost there was doubt because I didn't know if there was ever a chance to come back [to another slam final] as the level in tennis is a super high,"" Thiem, who made his ATP Tour debut in 2011, said.

""I mean, if you're not on your top, you can lose to anybody in the draw and the same doubts were here before the match and also so during the match: 'What happens if it goes 0-4? What happens if I don't take this chance? Will I ever get another chance again?'

""So there are always doubts and it's a big, big relief that, well, these doubts are gone now.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
239,WNBA star Maya Moore marries Jonathan Irons after helping overturn his prison sentence,"(CNN) Four-time WNBA champion Maya Moore has tied the knot with Jonathan Irons, the man whose wrongful conviction she helped overturn.

The pair met in 1998 in a prison ministry when Moore was a teenager and Irons was serving a 50-year sentence for burglary and assaulting a homeowner with a gun -- a conviction that was overturned by a judge in March this year.

He walked free in July having served 22 years of the sentence, and Moore, who sat out an entire season to help overturn the conviction, revealed on Wednesday that the pair had married.

""We wanted to announce that we are super excited to continue the work that we've been doing together but doing it as a married couple,"" Moore told Good Morning America

241,WNBA players react to Breonna Taylor settlement,"(CNN) WNBA players repeated their calls for the officers who killed Breonna Taylor to be arrested after hearing news of the historic settlement between the family and the city of Louisville, Kentucky.

The league, which began its playoffs on Tuesday, dedicated the 2020 season to Taylor and the Say Her Name movement , which raises awareness for Black female victims of police violence.

All season, in Bradenton, Florida, WNBA players have worn warmup shirts with the words ""Black Lives Matter"" displayed on the front and ""Say Her Name"" on the back, along with Taylor's name on their jerseys.

Earlier on Tuesday, it was announced that the city of Louisville had agreed to pay $12 million to the family of Taylor and institute sweeping police reforms in a settlement of the family's wrongful death lawsuit.

""That's it?"" Angel McCoughtry of the Las Vegas Aces, who spearheaded the WNBA's campaign, said to reporters when she was told of the news.

She later went on to say, ""You know, yeah, they deserve millions, but first of all, that's not a lot of millions. And then second of all, why aren't they (the officers) arrested? What else do we need to do? What else do people need to see?""

When Brittney Sykes, who plays for the No. 3 seed Los Angeles Sparks, was asked what she thought about the news on the settlement, she immediately asked, ""They charge the cops?""

When she was told no, she then said, ""Then that's my reaction.""

""I mean, yeah, money is cool, but did they charge the cops?"" Sykes said. ""And they didn't, so our job isn't done.""

Sparks' Candace Parker said the settlement is ""a step.""

""But this isn't what our goal was,"" she said. ""And obviously, we wear Breonna Taylor's name on the back of our jersey, but she represents so many other women that have been killed because of police brutality. I think as a mother, there's no amount of money that could take that away. So I don't think that does anything.""

Breanna Stewart of the Seattle Storm had similar thoughts.

""My initial reactions are obviously, it's a step in the right direction,"" Stewart said. ""I think that a settlement is not justice. Money is not getting justice for Breonna Taylor or her family, and those officers still need to be arrested. I think that the spotlight has kind of been on Louisville and (Kentucky) Attorney General Daniel Cameron, and I hope that he continues to do what needs to be done and arrest her killers.""

There are eight teams in this year's WNBA playoffs. There are single-elimination games for the first and second rounds and a best-of-five format for the semifinals and finals. The Aces, who earned the No. 1 seed, and the No. 2 seed Storm each have received byes and won't take the court until the semifinals.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

244,'Toto Wolff of Formula E' aims to make sparks fly for Mercedes,"(CNN) His boss might be famed Mercedes F1 chief Toto Wolff, but Ian James is bringing his own ""passionate"" approach as head of the marque's fledgling Formula E team.

The Briton has been tasked with turning Mercedes , the dominant force of Formula 1, into the front-runner in the electric racing series.

Its appearance in Formula E is down in no uncertain terms to a dramatic and very public U-turn by Wolff, who was an early skeptic of the series.

He even said at the team's unveiling he ""didn't believe that Formula E could make it.""

Now, though, Wolff is a fully fledged convert, and he turned to James to lead Mercedes' venture into electric motor sport.

Ian James in Riyadh at the start of the Formula E 2019-20 season.

James shuns comparisons with Wolff, but also aims to copy his boss.

""It's brilliant to work with someone like Toto,"" said James. ""At a race weekend, we speak on multiple occasions. His focus is Formula 1 but he is still very much involved in the Formula E programme.

""What I try to do is the same as Toto, which is holistic. I'm passionate about racing and making sure we're always moving in the right direction. He does that very well.

""He'll leave us to it but he offers great advice when it comes to drivers or analyzing what went wrong at a race and what could have been done better.""

Wolff v Wolff in Formula E

Ian James and Toto Wolff at the Mercedes-Benz EQ Formula E Team launch with the teams' drivers Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne.

Despite Wolff's split interest and direction, James is adamant it will have no bearing on Lewis Hamilton or Mercedes' continued ambition to remain No.1 when the F1 season gets under way in Australia next month.

But the Austrian is not the only Wolff James has to deal with. Toto's wife Susie, team principal of the Venturi team , is a partner in using the Mercedes EQ powertrain but also a grid rival.

James laughs at the idea he might be caught in the midst of a Wolff vs. Wolff on-track battle. ""It's certainly a unique position to be in,"" he said. ""But it's great to have Susie on board as she's someone I can have a very open dialogue with.

""We know if we take the right approach and work collaboratively, we can develop both teams faster together. And it would be a dream if all four drivers are fighting for the top spots. Then it gets serious.""

Like Wolff, James' passion for motor sport growing up lay in F1, first getting hooked at the age of five or six.

For him, the standout early moment was spilling onto the circuit at Silverstone when Nigel Mansell won the 1991 British Grand Prix and famously gave rival Ayrton Senna a lift back to the pit lane after he ran out of fuel at the finish.

After studying mechanical engineering at university, James' first job came at McLaren working on the Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren for three and a half years before a switch to Mercedes where he has worked for the last 15 years.

'We're racers'

His roles have been multifarious: part of the team behind the introduction of KERs in 2011 and helping the returning Mercedes to a first victory the following season with Nico Rosberg. But he was also heavily involved in the powertrain development which led to the first world titles in 2014 and the ongoing dominance.

""I'm a jack of all trades, master of none,"" he said. ""I'm an engineer by trade but genuinely a bad one. I've had time in finance and marketing, in program management. It's been a mixed bag.

""And with this, I was lucky -- it was genuinely too good to turn down, not just getting back into motor sport which is a passion of mine but also the opportunity to start up a business.""

And like any motor sport business, the primary goal is winning.

""Internally, there's enough understanding and empathy that expectations are kept in check in our rookie year in a complex series,"" he said. ""But externally we're the team with the three-pointed star, one linked with great success in F1 and DTM before that.

""It takes time, look at F1 for example. But we want to win the competition as we're racers. The mid-term goal is to get into championship contention but we're aware how challenging that will be.

""Of all the things I've done, this will be very hard to top. We're at the start of this journey and making sure we bring the results and build up the business to make sure that it's ready for the future.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

Bouncing pole

After going clear in the first round, Maher rode into a packed O2 arena in the second round in the knowledge another error-free ride would hand him victory over Ireland's Darragh Kenny and Balou du Reventon, who had been leading with two time faults over two rounds.

Maher, an Olympic champion at his home London Summer Olympics in 2012, knows all about performing under pressure.

But for a split second, it looked as if Maher had thrown it all away. Approaching the third fence, the big-striding Explosion W touched a pole. It bounced up in the air as the crowd gasped, but didn't fall.

""I took some risk, I didn't go too fast to jump the clear round,"" said Maher, whose win was applauded by American rock star Bruce Springsteen. ""I had some luck over there on the pink one and it stayed up. I knew it would be my day,"" said the 36-year-old Maher, the only rider to produce two clear rounds.

""I just tried to keep my eye on the job, but I know, when he touches a fence like that, normally, he doesn't touch another fence in the course,"" said Maher. ""I had a little luck, that's what sports is all about.""

An emotional Maher also paid tribute to his team.

Maher and Explosion W finished their stellar season on a high in Prague.

""Just amazing feeling, to be able to win here, on this horse, and the people that are around me, to make this possible, they all know who they are. It's an amazing feeling towards the end of the year.""

GCL Super Cup

The four-day Global Champions Playoffs will end on Sunday with the €6.4 million GCL Super Cup for teams.

Last year, Eduardo Alvarez Aznar of Spain teamed up with Holland's Marc Houtzager and Maikel van der Vleuten to take the inaugural GCL Super Cup for the Madrid in Motion team.

Madrid in Motion will join Paris Panthers, Valkenswaard United, Shanghai Swans, Monaco Aces and Cannes Stars in Sunday's final, which will see the winning team ride away with €3 million in prize money.

Friday's semifinals saw the shock elimination of pre-event favorites London Knights, led by Maher, and the St. Tropez Pirates.

The London Knights had finished the regular season at the top of the leaderboard for the second year running, with €2.3 million in prize money. The Pirates, led by last year's LGCT Super Grand Prix champion Edwina Tops-Alexander of Australia, had finished the regular season in second place, with €1.7 million in earnings.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

253,English rugby union bosses reviewing slave-era song used as chant,"(CNN) England rugby union bosses are reviewing the use of the slave-era song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" as a chant by fans, saying many may not be aware of its ""historical context.""

The Rugby Football Union (RFU) did not immediately respond to CNN but in a statement released to British media the organization said it was determined to ""accelerate change and grow awareness,"" as the Black Lives Matter movement prompts corporations and institutions to rethink how they operate.

In recent weeks following George Floyd's death , a number of British organizations , such as the Bank of England, and businesses have been reviewing their historical associations with slavery.

""The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve diversity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness,"" the governing body said in a statement.

""The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or its sensitivities.

""We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.""

English rugby union fans at the HSBC London Sevens at Twickenham Stadium on June 2, 2018 in London.

Former England rugby union player Maggie Alphonsi spoke out about why she no longer sings the song, writing on Twitter : ""I will NEVER stop using my voice!!""

Brian Moore, a former English rugby union player and commentator said : ""The world has moved on and, rightly, things that were normal then should not necessarily be normal now ... It should be celebrated in its rightful context.""

But former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan posted a news story about the issues around the song on Instagram with the caption: ""Please tell me if I am wrong ... but this surely can't be right !!??""

Is it right for rugby fans to sing a slave-era song?

The song ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.

But for the last three decades, the familiar melody has also been the adopted anthem of England's rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays.

And therein lies the problem.

Cornell Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often White?

""A slap in the face to the history of slavery,"" Cornell William Brooks, then president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Brooks is now Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations and Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out in 2017, said singing ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" to cheer a rugby team was a matter of ""ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance,' while American academics have called it cultural appropriation

Three years ago, when asked by CNN whether the RFU would be reviewing the use of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" an spokesperson for English rugby's governing body said: ""Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades. It is sung by fans to get behind the England rugby team.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

257,How billionaire owners changed European football,"Global Investment How billionaire owners changed European football

(CNN) — European football is no stranger to billionaire owners, and the latest deep-pocketed investor to show interest in acquiring a team stirred the English Premier League as it lay dormant during the coronavirus lockdown.

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is part of a three-party consortium attempting to buy Newcastle United. The other partners are PCP Capital Partners, a venture capital and private equity company run by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, and private equity and real estate firm Reuben Brothers.

For Newcastle fans, the proposed takeover heralds overdue change.

After 13 years under the ownership of Mike Ashley, the British businessman who runs retail brand Sports Direct, the feeling is that the club has been starved of investment for too long.

Newcastle, a powerful force in English football during the 1990s, suffered two relegations under Ashley’s tenure. The decision to temporarily rename the club stadium to The Sports Direct Arena in 2011 was also met with fan resentment.

Hostility to the Ashley regime probably explains why a survey by the Newcastle United Supporters Trust in April found that 96.7% of the more than 3,397 fans questioned were in favor of the new ownership group, which is being fronted by PCP.

The hope is that the new owners can inject more money into the club and propel Newcastle back to the top of English football.

The takeover has been rumbling on for months with other investors reportedly interested in buying the club. Before a takeover goes through, any successful bid must pass English football’s Owners’ and Directors’ test.

“If the fans have faith in the owners then that builds trust and trust builds time,” Kieran Maguire, a university lecturer on football finance and author of The Price of Football, tells CNN Sport.

“If it was me [as a new owner], the focus would be to have a strategy, have a director of football who can therefore say, ‘This is the way that Newcastle United is going to go forwards, this is going to be our style of play in conjunction with the manager.’

“It’s the dull stuff, it’s the back office, the business operations that I would address first. Fans are looking for a marquee signing [but] I would say that just signing for the sake of signing is a way to waste money.”

Chelsea and Manchester City set the trend for courting big-name signings following takeovers by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Abu Dhabi ruler Sheikh Mansour respectively.

The Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), in particular, was quick to throw money at City. Maguire says the club spent £62 million ($77 million) on transfers in 2008, the summer after Sheikh Mansour took charge, which included breaking the British transfer record in the purchase of Brazilian forward Robinho.

That was about 12 times what the club had spent the previous year, and City’s outgoings on players only grew in the years that followed.

Two seasons later, the likes of David Silva, Yaya Touré, Mario Balotelli and Edin Džeko were all brought in as, according to Maguire, £165 million ($204 million) was splashed on transfers in 2011; the season after that came Sergio Aguero, who helped deliver City its first league title for more than 40 years in dramatic fashion.

“It is known that wealthier clubs are more successful over the long term than their rivals with fewer resources,” Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at data company Gracenote, tells CNN Sport.

“When the current owners took full control in 2008, Manchester City were outside the top 20 richest clubs, and not amongst England's six wealthiest teams.

“The investment made by the owners made Manchester City competitive in the transfer market with the top English clubs, improving the team to the point that they could regularly challenge for trophies.”

In comparison to other English top-flight teams, Mike Ashley’s limited investment in Newcastle has seen the club twice drop into the Championship and seldom finish in the Premier League's top half. Manchester City’s Abu Dhabi owners invested heavily in player signings after taking over the club in 2008. Four Premier League titles have been won since, though the Champions League trophy has proved elusive. The dominant force in French football, PSG has failed to top Ligue 1 only twice since the Qatari owners bought the club. Much like City, PSG's domestic hegemony hasn't translated into European success.

Gleave also notes that City was rated the 68th best team in Europe when ADUG took over according to Gracenote’s Euro Club Index, which ranks all European football clubs based on competition results over a four-year period.

The club has risen up the pecking order under a number of different managers since then, before acquiring the top spot under Pep Guardiola in 2019.

Today, the chances of Newcastle matching the sort of spending that propelled City to success are remote given the restrictions football clubs must adhere to.

In the Premier League, a club can make losses of up to $130 million over three seasons and $33 million over three years for UEFA competitions. On Thursday, UEFA eased its regulations for one year due to Covid-19.

The latter’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations won’t immediately apply to Newcastle, but the club will need to be compliant if it wishes to compete in Europe in the near future as UEFA’s checks date back three years.

“If you take a look at both Manchester City and Chelsea when they were acquired by Sheikh Mansour and Abramovich, the initial transfer policy was scattergun and it was very hit and miss,” says Maguire.

“The advantage that both Chelsea and Manchester City had was that both clubs were operating in the pre-Financial Fair Play environment.

“Although I think Newcastle [might] have opportunity to spend more money than they have historically, they can’t just spend £100 million ($124 million) and write it off as easily as Chelsea and Manchester City were able to do back in the pre-Financial Fair Play days.”

Money spent on stadium infrastructure, a club’s academy, its women’s team, or community projects falls outside spending restrictions. City’s Abu Dhabi owners have been able to invest in a state-of-the-art academy stadium and training facilities around the Etihad Stadium.

“Like any new owners coming in, it'll be important that [Newcastle] have got the right people to give them the right advice to make sure they're spending their money as cleverly as possible … to maximize every pound that they are going to invest in,” sports lawyer Daniel Geey tells CNN Sport.

“Anyone expecting owners to come in even with very deep pockets and to spend like, for example, Roman Abramovich did, or Sheikh Mansour has done with Manchester City – I think those days are a little bit behind the Premier League.”

“In the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. It’s a well-run club financially.” Kieran Maguire

Newcastle may also benefit from Ashley’s frugal ownership if the new consortium purchases the club.

“If he’d been fairly loose with the cash, it could be that the new owners would inherit a club where they could only go and spend an extra £20 million ($24.5 million) next season because the losses from the last couple of years were so high,” explains Maguire.

“But in the case of Newcastle, it wipes its own face. It’s a well-run club financially. Which means of that £105 million ($130 million) loss, all of that is practically available to the new owners immediately.”

Overspending does have consequences. City has been banned from the Champions League for the next two seasons for contravening FFP rules, although the club has called the charges “entirely false” and is appealing the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport is due to announce its decision on City’s appeal in early July.

Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the president of French side Paris Saint-Germain, which is owned by sovereign wealth fund Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), has also been investigated by UEFA for illegal spending.

PSG has won the Ligue 1 title seven times since QSI took control of the club in 2011.

It smashed the transfer record by signing Neymar Jr. for $263 million from Barcelona in 2017, the same window that Kylian Mbappe also joined from AS Monaco.

An investigation launched in September 2017 to determine whether PSG had contravened FFP regulations was concluded last year when CAS upheld PSG’s appeal against the case.

Notably, for all their domestic success, neither City nor PSG have attained the same heights in Europe.

City lost to English rivals Liverpool and Tottenham in the final eight of the past two seasons, while PSG has fallen in the round of 16 in the past three campaigns, never reaching the semifinals under the Qatari owners.

But there’s little doubt that long term investment in a football club can yield returns, particularly in England’s top-flight league.

City is today part of City Football Group (CFG), a global network of associated clubs which includes teams in the United States, Australia, Japan and Uruguay.

Originally owned solely by ADUG, the China Media Capital consortium bought a 13% stake for $400 million in December 2015, while US private equity giant Silver Lake acquired just over 10% of CFG for $500 million last year.

“The Manchester City model, which is to buy lots of clubs around the world, is proving to be of benefit to them,” says Maguire.

“Very much the case at present is that Manchester City is the mothership and if they identify a good player in Spain or Uruguay or Australia or New York or wherever, that individual could then potentially be acquired by Manchester City at a very reasonable fee at a later point in time.

“It is a good strategy and I think it will reap its rewards in due course.”

Of course, the Abu Dhabi owners are 12 years down the line with City. The Newcastle deal is yet to be processed and has come under intense scrutiny since news of the potential ownership change surfaced.

Human rights group Amnesty argued that Saudi Arabia’s interest in Newcastle serves as “a PR tool to distract from the country's abysmal human rights record,"" while Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of late journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said the takeover would “stain” the Premier League.

Last month, Khashoggi’s children publicly forgave their father's killers, sparing five government agents the death penalty. The CIA concluded in 2018 that bin Salman personally ordered Khashoggi's murder, which the crown prince denies.

Qatari-based media giant beIN Media Group has also voiced concerns about the proposed takeover given Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in illegally streaming football matches.

BeIN CEO Yousef Al-Obaidly wrote to the Premier League, alluding to the ""direct role"" Saudi Arabia has had in the ""launch, promotion and operation"" of alleged pirate streaming service beoutQ.

Earlier this week, the World Trade Organization ruled that Saudi Arabia had acted unlawfully in relation to beoutQ's operation, a decision that was welcomed by UEFA.

Under Premier League rules, owners of clubs can be disqualified if they don’t pass the Owners’ and Directors’ test before acquiring a club.

Both Newcastle and the Premier League declined to comment when contacted by CNN in relation to the takeover.

The PIF and Saudi officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the takeover and criticism from Amnesty and Cengiz, while the Saudi Ministry of Media did not respond to the piracy claims.

Whether the new consortium will successfully purchase Newcastle hangs in the balance.

If the deal goes through, there will be an expectation the Magpies punch above their mid-table performances of recent seasons. But given the competitive nature of the Premier League, success is unlikely to come quickly or easily.

“I think the new owners will be able to bridge that gap [with the league’s top teams], but part of the reason that gap exists is because the other clubs are global brands,” says Maguire.

“It will take time for Newcastle to expand their influence on a more global sphere. But if they can qualify for Europe on a couple of occasions then they will become Saudi Arabia’s local club, as it were.”",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
258,​​Liverpool: The agonizing wait for a first Premier League title,"1990 / 91 30 years of dreaming Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football’s biggest prize

Gary Gillespie doesn’t remember how he and his teammates celebrated Liverpool winning the English first division title in 1990. “We probably got together and had a few drinks and reminisced about the season,” the former Liverpool defender tells CNN, chuckling at his hazy recollection.

There was little reason to especially savor that year’s yield, Liverpool’s 18th league title and Gillespie’s third in five seasons, because winning was what the club did. Springtime in Liverpool was the season for picking up trophies.

There was satisfaction and relief, an uplift to the red half of the city after a heartbreaking decade, but not the intoxicating hit on the senses that usually comes with the glory of being the best in the land.

Liverpool, it was assumed, would do it all again in the seasons to follow, or come close at least. No one knew the 1989/90 campaign was an ending, a full stop on what had been an unforgettable sentence in English football history.

“Everybody was used to winning and maybe took it for granted, and, anytime you take anything for granted in life, sometimes it comes back and smacks you in the face,” says Gillespie, “and that’s exactly what happened because we’re talking about this 30 years down the line, and Liverpool haven’t managed to win a title since.”

This year was supposed to be different. Jurgen Klopp’s men were 25 points ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City, within two victories of winning English football’s biggest prize, before the coronavirus pandemic caused the world to pause.

As the 30th anniversary of the club’s last league title success is marked, the wait continues. Agonizing, uncertain, with the story of the club’s revival missing its final page.

‘Managed decline’

1980s Britain. Margaret Thatcher’s decade. The city of Liverpool is fighting for survival.

The docks, once the heartbeat of Liverpool's prosperity, have been in decline since the 1970s. Manufacturing is shrinking, economic stagnation is sharp, the population is in decline, inner-city homes are falling into decay and unemployment is high. The city is also the first in the UK to be hit by the heroin epidemic that will go on to wreck a generation.

“Liverpool was being forced on its knees,” lifelong Liverpool supporter and retired academic Gordon Jenkins, 61, tells CNN. “I remember Chelsea fans used to wave £20 notes at us and say, ‘we’ve got loads of money.’”

On a red-hot July day in 1981, thousands of well-wishers lined London's streets to cheerily wave Union flags in celebration of Charles and Diana's wedding in the English capital. Two-hundred miles away, Liverpool was burning. Appalling economic conditions, combined with tensions between the police and the African-Caribbean community, had exploded into anger, rapidly descending into nine days of disorder which resulted in hundreds of injuries, arrests and one death.

Widely referred to as the Toxteth Riots, locally it is known as the ‘uprising.’

“This was a city without leadership,” wrote Michael Heseltine, the cabinet minister who would go on to construct a framework to revive Liverpool, in his autobiography.

“We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.” Geoffrey Howe, UK finance minister, 1979-83

In the aftermath of the unrest, Thatcher’s closest ministers talked of a “managed decline” of the city, National Archives files would reveal in 2011, with Thatcher's finance minister, Geoffrey Howe, warning: ""We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.""

It was during this decade Liverpudlians came to see themselves as outsiders, separate from the rest of Britain. Thatcher had polarized and radicalized. A broken working-class city which, historically, had not always leaned to the political left turned red.

But during these divisive times the people had football, two of the country’s outstanding teams in Liverpool and Everton. The beautiful game gave Liverpudlians heroes and hope. Football, says Jenkins, was, and still is, “inexorably woven into the fabric of why we are who we are.”

From 1981 to 1990, the two Merseyside clubs between them won nine league titles, two European Cups, a Cup Winners' Cup, three FA Cups and three League Cups.

Liverpool Football Club had become the bastion of invincibility former manager Bill Shankly had envisaged when rebuilding the club in the 1960s. Shankly’s successors, all appointed from within, had carried the torch. Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish. Seamless successions upon which a dynasty was built.

“I was there eight years, the worst we ever finished in the league was second,” Gillespie, who left Liverpool for Celtic in 1991, says. “If you finished second it was deemed a failure, you’d had a poor season regardless of what else you’d won.""

The league title was, says Gillespie, the ""be all and end all” and this was especially the case in the latter half of the decade when English clubs were indefinitely banned from European competition following the Heysel disaster in 1985.

“We never got allowed to get carried away,” Gillespie says, identifying the camaraderie formed on boozy nights out as one of the reasons for the club’s success.

“The coaching staff were always calling us ‘big heads’ and any opportunity they had they would try to knock you down. There was never too much praise for us. I don’t think we needed it.

“When we came in after games, we would have to tie our boots so it was easier for the coaching staff to put the boots away. When we took our kit off, we just didn’t throw it on the floor; we had to put the shorts in a pile and the tops in a pile. It was little things like that that kept you grounded.”

A city grieving

Though football saved the city during this decade, it was also the source of unimaginable pain.

On April 15, 1989, Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace in Hillsborough, Sheffield, during an FA Cup semifinal. Ninety-six men, women and children unlawfully killed, an inquest would find 28 years later, due to police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command.

Players had watched the injured and dying being carried away on advertising hoardings used as emergency stretchers and, in the weeks that followed, provided solace for the grieving. At one stage, the 38-year-old Dalglish, by now Liverpool’s player-manager, attended four funerals a day.

Adding to the suffering were the false accusations, published on the front page of the Rupert Murdoch-owned English newspaper ‘The Sun’ immediately after the disaster, that Liverpool fans had urinated on police and pickpocketed dead victims.

“It [the disaster] left its mark on a lot of people,” says Gillespie, conceding that the players still do not like to talk about the tragedy.

At the start of that year, defending league champions Liverpool had been in an unfamiliar position: fifth in the league and nine points behind leaders Arsenal. And, so, the second half of the season was spent in relentless pursuit of the Londoners, with Liverpool eventually bumping Arsenal from the summit with two games remaining thanks to 21 wins in 24 games. Yet the championship was not yet won. The end-of-season title-decider was still to come.

Arsenal’s April visit to Anfield had been rescheduled to the final day of the season because of the Hillsborough disaster, resulting in the jittery Londoners arriving on Merseyside needing to beat their rivals, who six days earlier had won the FA Cup, by two goals to become champions.

No one expected Arsenal to win but this Friday night match under the lights was made legendary as soon as the final whistle blew. In a hallucinatory ending, with seconds remaining and the visitors 1-0 ahead, Arsenal's Michael Thomas burst from midfield and scored, securing an extraordinary 2-0 win -- and the championship -- for the Gunners.

At the final whistle, television cameras capture Dalglish standing silently near the Liverpool dugout, looking into the middle-distance.

“When Arsenal score, you can see a lot of them (Liverpool players) collapse to the floor. They were playing three games a week; they’d been going to all the funerals, and there was a sense that a lot of them were exhausted,” says Gordon.

Business as usual

For those who witnessed it, the 1988/89 season finale lives strong in the memory. But when Liverpool's players returned to pre-season training four weeks later, no one at the club mentioned the Arsenal defeat, or even the previous campaign.

“The coaching staff, the manager, the whole ethos of the club was to never look back, to never linger, regardless of whether you had won the title or lost it. It was just something that was ingrained in us,” Gillespie explains.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade ... it was a remarkable achievement.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

Liverpool’s only major signing that summer was Swedish defender Glenn Hysen, bought from Fiorentina for £600,000 ($670,472).

The new season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 9-0 thumping of Crystal Palace, but this was not a particularly dazzling Liverpool vintage. A 4-1 loss to Southampton led to an indifferent patch and, while Liverpool ended the year topping the table, by March Aston Villa had the initiative.

Meet the 1989/90 squad

Yet Villa stuttered. A home loss to Manchester City was followed by a 3-3 draw with Norwich City and, as any seasoned predator would, Liverpool capitalized. On April 28, 1990, having that day beaten QPR 2-1 at Anfield, Liverpool regained the title.

“To win the championship after a heartbreaking decade … it was a remarkable achievement,” says Gordon.

“We’d been so successful for so long, to say we took it for granted wasn’t quite the case because it was always a great privilege to be a Liverpool supporter, [but] it was like normal service being resumed.”

Relief for a job well done

The smartphone, let alone a wireless network, was still some years from being part of everyday life, so it was left to Anfield’s stadium announcer to inform fans that Liverpool had won a sixth championship in 10 years.

Attending his first Anfield match that day was a seven-year-old John Gibbons. As Liverpool's players walked around the pitch to acknowledge the fans -- Bruce Grobbelaar, the club's idiosyncratic goalkeeper, performing handstands -- Gibbons remembers standing on a seat and serenading the champions to 'You'll Never Walk Alone.'

“It was all fairly understated,” Gibbons, a contributor to the Anfield Wrap podcast, tells CNN. “It was exciting, it was good, but if you’d told anyone in that ground that it would be 30 years until they’d win the next one, they wouldn’t have believed you.”

For the players, soaking up the pressures of expectation was over until the next season at least. “You put 10 months on hold, you give your all for 10 months,” says Gillespie. “Fortunately for us we were normally successful, but I don’t think you can enjoy it [a season].”

English football goes global

But at the beginning of the hedonistic 1990s, Liverpool would learn that even great clubs cannot pause to catch a breath. As Shankly once said: ""Football is relentless ... it goes on and on like a river.""

On the morning of February 22, 1991, with three months remaining of the 1990/91 season, photographers, TV crews and journalists had assembled at Anfield.

The city’s newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, had already prepared its front page because it knew what was to come: Dalglish, with Liverpool three points clear at the top of the table, was going to resign as Liverpool manager.

“Kenny Dalglish as a person has pushed himself to the limit,” said the Scot during the news conference, flashbulbs lighting up his face.

As a Liverpool player, Dalglish had won three European Cups, five league titles and four League Cups and added three more league titles and two FA Cups, including a league and cup double, as player-manager.

But this was a man who had taken on the city’s grief.

In a recent documentary about the man regarded as Liverpool’s greatest player, his family talked of the impact Hillsborough had on him: sleepless nights, mood swings, a rash covering his body, the struggle to make simple decisions.

He had also taken charge of the team shortly after 39 Juventus fans had died before the Italian club’s European Cup final against Liverpool in the Belgian city of Brussels. Supporters, the youngest just 11 years old, killed in a stampede before kick-off in the dilapidated Heysel stadium. It had all taken its toll.

“It all started going wrong when Kenny left,” says Gillespie.

The cracks, which arguably had first appeared when the team suffered an FA Cup semifinal loss to Crystal Palace in 1990, deepened. Celebrated players came to the end of their careers and new manager Graeme Souness made unsuitable, expensive signings.

Thirty miles away great rivals Manchester United were readying to dominate English football’s new age. The birth of the Premier League in 1992 led to a boom: wealth, glitz and the globalization of the English game. Successful on the pitch, United flourished commercially.

This is Anfield: The history of an iconic stadium Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally home to Liverpool’s city rivals Everton, who moved out in 1891. A year later, newly-formed Liverpool started to play there. The stadium, which has four stands, has become one of football’s most iconic venues. In 1906, the famous Spion Kop was constructed. It was converted into an all-seater stand in 1994. Around the stadium there are nods to the club’s past, such as The Shankly Gates, The Paisley Gateway and The Hillsborough Memorial. The Main Stand, built in the 19th century, has been redeveloped in the last decade, boosting Anfield’s capacity to 54,074.







In an interview with English newspaper The Guardian in 2002, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who would guide the Old Trafford club to 13 league titles, uttered a now famous sentence.

His greatest challenge, he said, was “knocking Liverpool right off their f***ing perch.”

With 20 league titles to Liverpool’s 18, the Manchester club can still crow, but United are not the dominant force they once were.

Back on their perch?

Some fans have been known to request selfies on the Kop with Chris Bolland, once they learn how long the 63-year-old has been attending matches at Anfield. A familiar face in the stands since 1966, he remembers plenty of title wins. But neither of his two sons have experienced the joy of watching the team lift a championship trophy.

The family has experienced close calls over the last three decades – second-place finishes under Rafael Benitez and Brendan Rodgers, and last season's astonishing 97-point haul which was eclipsed only by Manchester City -- but during those seasons Liverpool weren't unquestionably the best. Fans dreamed, but never fully believed.

This season, however, Klopp’s men have dropped just five points. Never has a team negotiated a season in England’s top flight in such a relentless, uncompromising manner.

Postponed indefinitely because of the pandemic, no one knows with certainty when or how English football will resume. If the Premier League season were unable to be completed, would Liverpool be denied the championship? For now, that is the unanswered question.

The nervousness which rumbled around Anfield at times last season as the team vied with Manchester City in one of the closest title races in recent memory – though they lost only once, Liverpool missed out on the title by a point – had vanished this season.

Winning the European Cup in Madrid last June, Klopp’s first major trophy as Liverpool manager, had strengthened the fans' faith in the players. They believed. But anxiety increases in uncertain times.

Joy Bratherton, 64, moved to Liverpool in 1974 to be nearer Anfield. Once just one of the few female faces among a crowd of thousands on the Kop, she was enduring sleepless nights even before a global pandemic stopped Liverpool's charge to the league title.

Whether Liverpool will win the Premier League is, she says, ""the first thing I think of in the morning and the last thing I think of in the nighttime.""

""I am having very mixed dreams when I doze off,"" she adds, speaking to CNN days before the UK was put into lockdown. ""The strain and stress of the last two seasons has been overpowering.""

It was after comfortably beating Manchester United in January that the first chants of “we’re going to win the league” echoed around Anfield. A new banner also popped up in the stands at the beginning of the year with the sentence, “This Bird Is Getting Back On Its Perch.”

But the deaths and suffering caused by coronavirus have changed perspectives. Dreams of winning a first league title in 30 years are no longer all-consuming.

“You’ll Never Walk Alone is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent.” Gordon Jenkins, Liverpool fan

""Not being able to be crowned champions for the foreseeable future is completely irrelevant. It absolutely doesn’t matter,"" says Jenkins.

""Jurgen Klopp, who is Bill Shankly reincarnated, has said football is the most important of the least important things and that just nails it completely. 'You’ll Never Walk Alone' is not just a song, it’s not merely an anthem, it’s a statement of intent. It’s not just about Liverpool people, it’s about people generally.

""If we didn’t win the league because it was voided, that would be unfair but not a disaster. The real wait is for when we can all go to the match again. That wait is more painful than whether we win the league or not.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
259,Peak Lenin: Climbing disaster showcased bravery and pioneering spirit of Soviet women climbers.,"Frozen in Time Forty five years ago, eight Soviet women climbers were pinned on top of a high mountain in the USSR in the worst storm in 25 years.

It was June 1974. The Cold War was verging on détente, though the Watergate scandal overshadowed the Moscow Summit between President Richard Nixon and his Soviet Union counterpart, Leonid Brezhnev.

A month later, thousands of miles away in Central Asia, close to the Himalayas in the shadow of Peak Lenin, another meeting took place between an American and a Russian.

Soviet Union Iran India China Soviet Union Iran Saudi Arabia India China Mongolia The map reflects modern-day geography; the Soviet Union border is based on the borders of the countries that were part of the USSR. Map credits: maps4news.com/©OSM, Encyclopedia Britannica In 1974, 170 climbers from a number of countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp in the southern part of the Soviet Union, on the border of what is now Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. They camped in the Pamir Mountains, or Pamirs, a range with some of the world's highest mountains. Many would climb or attempt the 7,134 meter (23,406ft) Peak Lenin. While not considered steep or technical, it is high and subject to severe weather.







Molly Higgins first saw Elvira Shatayeva as she came around a bend in the High Pamirs mountain range, sometimes known as “the roof of the world.”

An Outward Bound instructor traveling the Colorado Rockies, living out of a faded white sedan, Higgins had been asked to a month-long international mountaineering gathering hosted by the Russians.

Nineteen Americans, including two women, attended as part of the 1974 American Pamirs / USSR Expedition. Higgins, then 24, was a last-minute invitee when organizers, many unsure or uneasy about quite where women fit in on expeditions, realized that one woman did not seem like enough.

""I was ambitious and very self-confident, and I thought I was very strong,” recalls Higgins, now a clinical laboratory scientist in Whitefish, Montana.

She was with a crew carrying loads up to Camp II -- Crevasse Camp -- toward Krylenko Pass on the shoulder of Peak Lenin, the country’s second-highest mountain, when an earthquake shook the slopes.

Higgins remembers a creaking sound. Then an avalanche roared overhead, launching off the top of an ice tower above camp.

The avalanche darkened the air, scattered gear, and partially buried one person, with at least two others jumping into the crevasse to escape. Four among the crew had descended earlier to resupply, and for hours those in both groups dreaded that the others had died.

Yet all had survived, though in the lower group Allen Steck, a pioneering climber from Berkeley, California, was buried up to his neck. The two groups joyfully reunited at Camp 1, on the Krylenko moraine, and retreated, shaken, to base camp in an alpine meadow.

Some 170 climbers from 10 Western countries occupied a huge mountaineering camp, with another 60 Eastern European and Russian climbers and officials across a stream.

This was the first major American expedition allowed in the Soviet Union, which has some of the highest and most remote mountains in the world. The gathering was held to showcase the region and the skills of the host climbers and, it seemed, develop relationships with Cold War rivals. It was seen as a means to bring up young mountaineers and foster mountaineering relations between countries.

Meet the climbers

No one could ever have imagined how many things would go wrong that summer, events rained down by the skies and upthrust by the earth, nor the heroics that would ensue.

Yet the story of one of the greatest disasters in all of mountaineering has been almost completely lost.

Even many non-climbers know of Everest disasters and who Alex Honnold is. Yet almost no one today, climbers included, has ever heard about what befell eight Russian women in 1974. A Google search turns up nothing about the 45th anniversary last year.

“He is injured!”

Describing the retreat after the calamitous avalanche, Higgins says: “We came down through these huge boulders, around a corner, and there, standing up, was this absolutely gorgeous, bright-blue-eyed, muscular, bossy hottie on a boulder, and she’s got about four Russian guys around her, and she’s ordering them around.” The woman was in her mid-30s.

Spotting that an American, Mike Yokell, was limping -- after jumping into the crevasse beside Camp II to escape the avalanche -- Shatayeva called out, “He is injured! Take his pack!”

Shatayeva then wheeled around, looked at Higgins, and said in deep, careful tones, “I am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?”

“I am Elvira Shatayeva. I am Master of Sport. What are you?”

Master of Sport was the top credential in any sport in the status-aware Soviet Union, even more impressive when attained by a woman.

Higgins recalls: “I thought it was great. I didn’t want to be bossy like that, but here was a woman who really was capable. I wanted to be like her, that strong and that experienced. She was a heroine, right there.”

In an era of relatively few women climbers, Higgins had never met one who was the kind of climber and mountaineer she wanted to be. It was to be the young American’s only interaction with Elvira.

“I knew right then that it was a transforming moment.”

Awkward dynamic

Arlene Blum, a biophysical chemist and environmentalist from Berkeley, California, had applied to the American Alpine Club to join the American contingent, but was declined.

However, some Swiss climbers, through an international women’s climbing club, brought her in on their invitation to be part of a women’s team. The situation created an awkward dynamic when Blum, 29, arrived in the Pamirs and entered the jam-packed mess tent.

As she told the story in her memoir “Breaking Trail,” she approached the crowded American table, but was ignored.

She wrote, “I stood amid the roar of voices, holding my bread and caviar and wishing I could disappear. Blessedly, a striking blonde Russian woman waved me over to her table.”

Shatayeva introduced herself and welcomed Blum. As they talked, she told Blum that most Soviet men thought a women’s team would never succeed on the 23,406-foot Peak Lenin — her group’s aim.

“We plan to be the first women’s team to do it,” said Shatayeva. “Or maybe your group will be.”

Blum, put at ease, said, “Maybe we could all climb together.”

“That is impossible” was the swift reply. Blum could only surmise that the Soviets wanted the first women’s team to be their own. Shatayeva told Blum the larger plan: that the eight women would climb the peak by the Lipkin Ridge on the northeast side and descend the northwest ridge toward the smaller Razdelny Peak. Theirs would be the first traverse, by men or women, of the peak. They were to bivouac, or make a temporary camp, on top.

“Soviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.” Elvira Shatayeva, July 15, 1974.

“We will succeed,” she told Blum. “Soviet women are very strong. We have collective spirit and we work together.”

Blum today recalls Shatayeva’s “warmth and energy.”

“We shared a common goal of giving women the chance to climb high mountains and were so happy to be in this camp with other climbers who shared our delight in the mountains,” Blum reminisces.

She remembers feeling some concern about the ambitious plan to traverse Peak Lenin.

“This was in the days of the Cold War, when we were in competition with the Russians. I looked at their inadequate tents with button closures and [their] old-fashioned boots and thought how the Russian technology seemed to be going more into space than the mountains.”

“Cat-like blue eyes”

Christopher Wren, a climber and Moscow correspondent for the New York Times (he was to become bureau chief in December of that year), met Shatayeva in base camp early in the meet, which commenced in mid-July.

A passage (later anthologized) from his book “The End of the Line,” about his years in Russia and China, read: “A striking blonde with high cheekbones and cat-like blue eyes, she had come there to lead a team of the Soviet Union’s best women climbers in an assault on Lenin Peak.” Chatting with her over tea, he sensed a “steel core” beneath the surface.

The next time Wren saw Shatayeva was as he and two friends approached the top of Peak Lenin after a storm-blasted, two-night bivouac 1,000 feet below the summit, and spotted a splash of color, a blue jacket in a snow hollow.

“Someone,” he would write of that confused first impression, “seemed to be lying asleep in the bright sunshine.” He thought, An odd time for a nap.

Disciplined unit

Robert “Bob” Craig (who died in 2015, at 90), deputy leader for the American team and author of the subsequent expedition book, “Storm and Sorrow,” wrote: “For the most part, the women remained across the creek in the ‘Soviet Nationalities’ camp. They made several practice climbs, and we observed them a couple of times doing calisthenics in front of their tents.”

The women, whom he described as aged 22 to 35, appeared to be “very serious … still they sang songs together, and not infrequently we would hear their excited chattering and their laughter tinkling like bells across the valley.”

Elvira’s husband, Vladimir Shatayev, later wrote in his memoir, “Degrees of Difficulty,” that the women operated as a disciplined yet congenial unit. “Not once did we hear words of argument or contention.”

She told him, “You should read the minutes” of their meetings. “You men have never dreamed of such openness.”

Shatayeva had already organized the first all-women’s ascent of a 7,000-meter peak — Peak Korzhenevskaya (7,105 meters) -- in Tajikistan in 1972, and led a traverse of the double-summitted Ushba (4,710 meters) in Georgia the following year.

Two nights before the women set out, the American climbers Jed Williamson and Peter Lev strolled over to their camp to say hello and good luck. In a country of regulations, as Williamson, now a retired college president living in Hanover, New Hampshire, says, “It was the first time they were allowed to go without the company of men.” Four of the women had climbed Peak Lenin with males.

Dire natural circumstances

But no one could control weather or geology. The whole Pamirs meet was plagued by snow, rapidly developing avalanche hazard, an earthquake that shook avalanches down (with two more quakes later), and the worst storm seen in the region in 25 years.

At 1:00 a.m. on July 26, barely more than a day after Higgins and her group returned from Krylenko Pass, four climbers forging a new route on the north face of Peak of the 19th Party Congress (or Peak 19) were hit by an avalanche as they slept. Craig, the deputy leader for the American team, and his tent mate, Jon Gary Ullin, were buried. Ullin, 31, an affable and humorous airline pilot from Seattle, was crushed.

Their friends John Roskelley and John Marts had excavated both and tried to resuscitate Ullin when yet another avalanche hit, enveloping Craig again and sweeping away the tents and equipment.

Roskelley, Marts and Craig were then stranded in a snow cave for two days and dropped supplies in a superb collaborative helicopter rescue effort by the Soviets, who allowed Lev a key role as “drop person,” in which he had experience.

Lev, an avalanche forecaster and heli-ski guide, recalls the Russian helicopter being extremely powerful. “I was in the large open door, just hanging onto something,” he says, “and was able to get the drop ‘on their doorstep’” from about 50 or 75 feet above.

“The pilot deserves real credit.”

Five climbers who were not part of the meet and known to visitors only as “the Estonians” went missing on the East Face of Peak Lenin. Three were found to have died in an avalanche, and the other two were rescued and survived. Many accounts incorrectly say all five died.

For most in the assemblage, objectives changed in accordance with the conditions; although Roskelley and Jeff Lowe returned and completed the line up Peak 19, other climbers converged on the “standard” routes.

Meanwhile Higgins, while feeling lonely and isolated among the mostly male contingent, ended up in a group of four (herself; the expedition leader, Pete Schoening; Chris Kopczynski; and Frank Sarnquist) that climbed Peak Lenin via the Razdelny ridge on August 3.

The other American woman on the meet, the much-respected Marty Hoey -- who tragically died on Everest eight years later – also climbed the Razdelny side, with Lev, Bruce Carson and John Evans on August 4. Williamson started with them but, feeling ill, turned back.

While the mountain is not considered steep or technical, it is big and high and beset by challenging weather conditions, with sections of moderately steep ice, especially high on the Lipkin side.

Elvira Shatayeva and the Russian women made final preparations for Peak Lenin climb. July 30 - The Russian women’s team left Base Camp for Camp I. July 31 - The team took the Lipkin route and proceeded toward the summit without any problems. On August 3, Shatayeva called a rest day. August 3 – An American team of climbers behind the Russian women reported: “Cloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions.” August 4 - A major storm was forecast, and organizers recommended all climbers descend. The Russian women were seen walking in a line perhaps 400 feet below the summit. August 5 - The Russian women’s team radioed from the summit. August 6 - The women tried to descend but only managed a few hundred feet. Speaking to base then and August 7, they reported their struggles. Their final transmission came through at 20:30. August 8 - The storm was over. From their final camp, located about 400 meters below the summit, the American team set out for the summit with no idea of the events that had occurred above.

“Our summit day was so hard I couldn’t believe it,” Higgins says. “The altitude … I did some collapsing. It was a really humbling experience. I was very proud of it and so glad it was done.”

Jeff Lowe, a standout young climber (who died of natural causes in 2018), would much later post in an online thread: “[S]ome of the guys on the trip gave her a hard time, claiming she didn't have enough [expedition or alpine] experience to be there. Molly proved them wrong, though -- pulling her own weight and generally comporting herself in a competent manner.”

On August 3, Steck moved up on the Lipkin side with Wren and Jock Glidden. Steck wrote in his diary, as reported in his 2017 memoir, “A Mountaineer’s Life”: “Cloudy weather today and we have route-finding problems getting over to Camp III in whiteout conditions. Our altimeter tells us we are at about 5,800 meters,” or 19,030 feet. On August 4, the three took a layover day.

The Americans’ radios had been impounded in customs, so Steck’s group had only a weak radio on loan from the Soviets, and all countries had been put on different frequencies. That day, a major storm was forecast, and Vitaly Abalakov -- Master of Sport for mountaineering in the whole country (who died in 1986) -- recommended that all climbers descend to base. Steck’s group never received the message, nor did Richard Alan North of Scotland.

“Our summit day was so hard I couldn’t believe it.” Molly Higgins, May 5, 2019.

From July 31 to August 3, North, a biomedical scientist now retired and living in Niwot, Colorado, and teammates moved up a “new though not particularly difficult” route to join the Lipkin route.

On August 4, by then climbing alone, North cut steps, as was commonly done in the era, in the steepening ice -- tedious, tiring work accompanied by altitude-induced hallucinations. He reached the top and then descended, slipping a few times and gripping his ice axe for self-arrest on the hard snow. At the foot of the steep section, perhaps 400 feet below the summit, he met the Russian women, walking in a line.

It was windy, with visibility “just a few meters,” he says.

They exchanged greetings, and North was later to recreate the scene in Summit magazine, writing: “They are moving slowly up but in high spirits.

“‘You get a bit short of breath up there,’ I remark jokingly. But the humor is lost on them.

“‘Ah! We are strong. We are women,’ they reply.”

North descended, passing some Soviet men who summited behind him and later joined his descent.

He believes the women climbed the steep icy section and camped that night on the eastern edge of the summit ridge, before moving to the summit the next day.

On the morning of August 5, on the somewhat more straightforward Razdelny side, a Soviet climber came to Blum’s tent at Camp III, the top camp, with a message from base saying, “A storm is predicted. Do not try to climb.”

Still, the air remained calm and fairly clear, people had come a long way and were in position, and some chose to try. Blum, Heidi Lüdi and Eva Isenschmid of Switzerland started up, though the latter two carried extra gear and planned on a possible bivouac, so Blum hastened ahead, with a turnaround time in mind and hoping to beat any weather.

Nearing the top when the storm hit shortly before noon, Blum retreated, soon fighting the wind and blizzard. She was fortunately joined by Williamson, who had started up for the summit again, also with a firm turnaround limit and an eye on the weather. He had retreated from very high -- the summit plateau at 22,800 feet.

Williamson broke trail and urged Blum on when she sat, exhausted. On the way down the pair saw Blum’s two teammates and a Bavarian woman friend and entreated them to descend as well; Isenschmid, a 23-year-old photographer and artist whom North calls a “gentle soul,” was to die in the storm the next day despite strenuous rescue efforts from her partners and French, German and American climbers.

Meanwhile, Steck, Wren and Glidden hiked up to just below the major ridge and in wild storm conditions stopped and camped at 22,000 feet, their Camp IV, the final one.

The Soviet women’s team summitted late afternoon on August 5, carrying full loads (climbers not on a traverse can leave some gear below). At 5:00 p.m. they radioed base camp and said that in the deteriorating visibility they were having difficulty making out the descent and had set up their tents to wait for a break.

Accounts of the ensuing events differ, but Vladimir Shatayev in his book notes that base camp agreed, saying to descend immediately if possible or wait the night. Craig’s book reports that Abalakov told them to descend first thing in the morning on the Lipkin, the route they had ascended and knew.

That night Steck’s group wore their boots and all clothing to bed in case their tent shredded. The Americans had nylon tents with zippers and aluminum poles. Holding up the tent poles, though one snapped, they would outlast the storm. The Soviet women had cotton tents with toggle closures and wooden poles, and according to Craig the wind wrecked two tents the first night.

The morning of August 6 brought five inches of snow at base and, higher, a foot of snow and winds of 70 to 80 mph. Climbers gathered to hear radio transmissions by translator as Shatayeva radioed reports of the sustained whiteout and worsening wind.

At what Vladimir Shatayev states as 5:00 p.m. (though Craig indicates as some hours earlier), Shatayeva reported that one woman had become ill and another seemed unwell. Abalakov told them to descend.

Abalakov spoke slowly and adamantly, according to Craig, saying to reach snow in which they could dig caves.

Craig wrote, “[I]t was implied that if the sick girl could not move and they could not achieve adequate shelter, they must leave her for the good of the group as a whole.”

As the women descended, Irina Lyubimtseva died, apparently freezing to death holding a safety rope for others.

Unable to dig caves in the hard, granular snow, the women somehow managed to put up two tents on a ridge only several hundred feet below the top. The ailing climbers deteriorated. Abalakov strongly directed continued descent by those who could move, according to Craig; Shatayeva said she understood and would try.

The times given vary, but that day or into the next, the ill women (Nina Vasilyeva and Valenina Fateyeva) died. Also that day or, by Shatayev’s account in the early hours after midnight, hurricane-force winds hit, exploding the tents and blowing away rucksacks, stoves and mittens. Five women huddled in a tent without poles, with three sleeping bags.

The next morning four Japanese climbers, bivouacked in a tent at 6,500 meters on the Lipkin side and possessing a strong radio, heard the transmissions in Russian and deduced trouble. Two of the Japanese climbers bravely set out to help but were blown off their feet and forced back. Other climbers on the mountain mobilized, but all were far lower.

Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye. When will we see the flowers again?

The final hours

The following excerpts are from Craig. Accounts and times differ somewhat, but Craig was in base camp and overall his account is considered sound, and an honest, earnest rendition.

August 7, “about” 08:00. Abalakov pressed Shatayeva as to whether the women were trying to descend. She replied with spirit: “Three more are sick; now there are only two of us who are functioning, and we are getting weaker. We cannot, we would not leave our comrades after all they have done for us.”

10:00 Shatayeva: “It is very sad here where it was once so beautiful.”

Noon. One more had died, two were dying. “They are all gone now. That last asked, ‘When will we see the flowers again?’ [Two] others earlier asked about [their] children. Now it is no use.”

15:30 [Disoriented] “We are sorry, we have failed you. We tried so hard. Now we are so cold.”

Abalakov in despair promised a rescue was underway.

17:00 Transmission unclear, but another woman seemed to have died. Three remained. Winds up high were estimated at 80 to 100 mph, the summit temperatures as minus 30 to minus 40 F.

18:30 “Another has died. We cannot go through another night. I do not have the strength to hold down the transmitter button.”

20:30 “Now we are two. And now we will all die. We are very sorry. We tried but we could not … Please forgive us. We love you. Goodbye.”

Vladimir Shatayev’s book identifies the last speaker not as his wife but Galina Perehodyuk, and suggests it was difficult to understand whether the word was “forgive” or “request.” He writes that twice more someone pressed the radio button, attempting contact with the world.

Steck says, “The events of that day are permanently etched into my brain.” On August 8 the American trio, unprepared, saw the first body on the face below the summit; Wren recognized Shatayeva. Signs of others were visible upslope. The four Japanese arrived at the same time, and the Americans borrowed their radio to call base, with Steck saying, “Something very strange, very sad has happened here.” Finding the other bodies above, they walked crying among them, amid the shreds of tent fabric and shards of poles.

Beyond Shatayeva, two women were half-buried in the snow; three, as Wren was to write in the New York Times, “sprawled across a torn tent, futilely pitched on a scooped‐out snow platform,” and another was frozen holding a rope leading downhill. The eighth was to be found beneath the others when Elvira’s husband and a support crew went up a week later to retrieve them.

That night at camp all three Americans were certain they heard women’s voices. “Russian voices,” says Steck. “We'd open the tent and no one was there.”

The reasons for the mass tragedy are many, sifted through with the benefit of hindsight.

The objective, as a traverse, put the women as camping on the summit, exposed to the worst of the storm. They had poor equipment. They were also under pressure, on show.

“They were the test group,” says Higgins. “They felt they needed to do it to uphold the standards of the women’s team.”

Wren wrote, “Rather than retreat when the storm came in, they made a miscalculation to wait until the visibility improved. I suspect that they did not want foreigners to think Russians were quitters.”

Many observed that Shatayeva felt great responsibility for her team.

Says Blum: “The women were so very loyal to each other. They stayed together until the end.”

Higgins expresses regret, respect and conflicting feelings over the series of events.

“Would it have been braver to say, ‘Let’s save the five of us?’... I just think it was really sad. I’ve felt,” she says honestly, “that she should have taken who she could and gotten out of there.

“It is huge,” she says feelingly of such a quandary. “It is a mortal decision.”

North, the last person to see the women alive (some accounts mistakenly have Scottish and Japanese climbers on the summit with them), says, “You could call them victims of circumstance.

“I don’t think without the international meet they would have been in that situation, in that weather. Same with Eva and Heidi. Because there were so many nations taking part and the overall world situation at that time, it was unusual to be there, so there was a bit of an element of people wanting to represent their nations that does not exist in normal mountaineering situations.”

John Evans (who has just died, January 9), in a published journal, “The Pamirs: Russia,” called the many fatalities “an extraordinarily sorrowful statistic … made even more distressing in the light of the very optimistic and positive intentions of our Russian hosts.” Thirteen were lost: the three Estonians, Jon Gary Ullin, Eva Isenschmid and the eight Russian women.

Anguished and noble

Williamson, in Camp III on Razdelny during the storm, says: “They weren’t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration. I’m just sad those conditions came together. The storm came in pretty fast and went fast. Two days later it was bluebird skies, and we were in shirtsleeves.”

The crucial decision was the one to stay on the summit. Still, a major turning point may have occurred days earlier, in that era when women climbers were often doubted and excluded.

On Peak Lenin, Shatayeva had at first welcomed the snow, on August 4 telling Vladimir by radio, “That’s good—it covers the tracks. So that there won’t be talk that we ascended along a trail” made by others.

Nearing the main ridge August 2, Shatayeva had radioed, “Everything so far is so good that we’re disappointed in the route.”

Yet August 3 she called a rest day. Three teams of Soviet men, one of which summitted August 4, were near, clearly coordinated to provide support if needed. Vladimir Shatayev wrote, “The possibility cannot be ruled out that it was precisely for this reason that the women were dragging out the climb, trying to break loose from the guardianship.”

Had they reached the top one day earlier, they would have been lower when the storm hit.

“They weren’t weak or stupid. I place no blame on them. Those conditions converged. It was the perfect storm. I have nothing but admiration.” Jed Williamson, June 23, 2019.

Now, 45 years on, women have long proved themselves in climbing and mountaineering, are widely visible on the crags and in the peaks, and accepted as peers.

The tale of the Russian women climbers is, as Higgins puts it, “one of the epic sad stories in modern climbing history.”

During the meet, different countries worked together in disastrous and even surreal circumstances. Other people had known the Russian women to be, as Blum put it in her book, “jubilant” on the mountain, and then witnessed an anguished and noble end.

“It is so enormously tragic, occurring at a time when more women were beginning to brave great challenges on rock and in mountains,” Higgins says. ""I wanted to be one of those women, and Elvira seemed invincible.”

260,Tayla Harris: 'I would be happy to go through it all again but I'd rather not',"(CNN) Muscles aching after an afternoon gym session, Tayla Harris is spending the early evening hanging laundry in the backyard of her Melbourne home. ""Pretty standard procedure,"" says the athlete who has experienced a far from ordinary 12 months.

Until last March, Harris was admired by many yet not widely recognized. As a young player in the women's Australian Football League (AFLW), a summer sport that is an Australian obsession, her focus had been on flourishing professionally in two sports -- on making a name for herself on the football field and, during the off season, in the boxing ring, too.

But a picture posted on Facebook last year of Harris playing for her team Carlton Blues elevated the then 21-year-old beyond the world of sport. She became one of the most talked-about sportswomen on the planet.

First came the vile messages, and they came thick and fast -- sexist, disturbing and damaging comments posted below a now iconic picture of Harris doing her job.

Harris' fearless response was then shared by thousands on social media, prompting celebrities, and even Australia's Prime Minister, to voice their support. She had stood up and spoken out. It changed her world.

""I would be happy to go through it all again, but I'd rather not,"" says Harris.

With one tweet Harris had made a lasting impression in the usually transitory world of social media, while the photograph is now a symbol of defiance. T-shirts with her silhouette can be bought and a bronze statue of her was unveiled on Australian Women's Day in September.

""I love it when a mum or a young daughter and son says to me 'thanks for standing up to what you stood up for,'"" Harris tells CNN Sport.

""If my example is going to help someone in any way, I would be happy to go through it all again. I'd rather not, but there's been so many amazing messages. It's been an eye-opening experience.""

'Here's a picture of me at work'

It is the opening minutes of the AFLW's Pride Game between the Western Bulldogs and Carlton on March 17, 2019, and Harris, the Blues' forward, has kicked the first goal of the game.

Photographer Michael Willson has brilliantly captured the athleticism of the act: she is mid-air, looking to her left, focusing on the trajectory of a ball which is out of shot. So gymnastically high is her right leg, her right foot is above her head. While a few feet from the ground, she is almost doing the splits.

What followed is said to have changed the landscape of women's sport in Australia.

Posting the picture on its 7AFL Facebook page, Australian broadcaster Channel 7 captions it ""photo of the year.""

Here's a pic of me at work... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals. pic.twitter.com/68aBVVbTTj — Tayla Harris (@taylaharriss) March 19, 2019

Few could have foreseen that the number of, in the broadcaster's words, ""inappropriate and offensive"" comments would lead to Channel 7 deleting the post 24 hours later because, it said, the messages had become difficult to monitor.

But erasing a picture that showcased the prowess of the women's game caused more damage. After all, such an act does not silence trolls.

""THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE PHOTO,"" tweeted Sam Kerr, one of the world's best female soccer players, echoing the thoughts of many. A few hours later, the hashtag ""Tayla"" was trending on Twitter.

At the time, Harris was at home getting ready for bed, ""just doing my thing,"" she says, when her phone started pinging. One notification rapidly following another.

""I didn't think 'oh, this is a really personal attack,"" Harris explains. ""I just thought, obviously this is a much bigger issue than just saying sexist things to people. It's actually the start of something much worse.""

After a phone conversation with the chief executive of a national project which aims to eliminate domestic and family violence, Harris proceeded to post a message which became the most liked tweet of 2019 in Australia.

""Here's a picture of me at work ... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals,"" Harris wrote. The tweet remains pinned at the top of her profile page.

""When I saw a little picture on Facebook and I'd see a young girl with a man who has made these comments, it was horrifying to think that this girl had to live, or be around someone, who is able to actually say these things. I thought about it in depth,"" Harris continues.

""I responded after an hour or two. I thought 'I have the photo, so I'll just put it up and just chuck that caption on' and what happened, happened. I didn't put it up as a f**k you to Channel 7, I just put it up because I thought it was a cool photo.""

Harris speaks next to Carlton CEO Cain Liddle during a press conference at Ikon Park.

Harris went to bed with around 20,000 Twitter followers but by the next morning had an additional 60,000. There was an apology from Channel 7 for sending ""the wrong message"" by removing the photo from its social media accounts, while Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the trolls ""cowardly grubs.""

With a weekend match looming, Harris restricted herself to one radio interview in the immediate aftermath, during which she described the comments as sexual abuse, and held a press conference to sate the appetite of media organizations around the world. Carlton provided her with a security guard for the next game, against Fremantle.

""Surreal,"" and a ""roller-coaster"" is how she sums up the week. ""For the most part it was all positive,"" she adds, ""but I had to check in with myself and make sure this was something I was OK with because it was a really full on and busy, confronting few weeks.

""The really important thing for me was not to dilute the messaging or say something that could be misinterpreted, so I made sure I was really clear and articulate.""

To understand Harris' inner strength, we must step back in time, to the first decade of the century when the self-confessed daddy's girl was growing up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and towering above her elementary schoolmates. She would grow to become 5ft 10in.

Her father Warren, a marine mechanic whom Harris describes as her best friend, encouraged his daughter to partake in whatever activity she wanted -- skateboarding, building boats, self defense, Aussie Rules -- and with such freedom came confidence and, significantly, courage.

""If I see someone suffering or needing help, I'm already doing something before my brain even knows it,"" Harris says.

""That's something I always have done and always will do. It's non-negotiable for me.

""There was a boy at school who would always pick on a girl who used to be my best friend in grade four because she had a disability. I was a big kid, I was tall, so instead of saying something I would stand physically in the way but, at one point, this boy was relentless so I took him down and, apparently, I pushed him to the ground and held him down and then I found myself in the Principal's office.

""My dad remembers the Principal saying, 'Tayla can't be doing those things because that will hurt the boy's self-esteem.' Dad went off his head. My dad still tells that story, about how wrong that particular incident was.""

Such spirit helped Harris -- who played Aussie Rules with boys until she was told to stop aged 14 -- rise to an elite athlete in two sports. She is unbeaten in seven professional fight and holds the Australian middleweight crown.

Yet like most women in sport, Harris has had to develop a thick skin. She was accustomed to online abuse long before a picture of that kick was posted online.

Her decision to join the Blues from the Brisbane Lions in 2018 stoked keyboard rage but a ""lightbulb moment"" after a conversation with a close friend helped her ride it out.

""He said 'why do you care what someone who you've never met and will probably never meet and have never done anything for you in your life think' so, from that moment, I was like 'why do I care what that weird scummy guy is saying',"" says Harris, conceding that putting up with trolls is likely her lot in life, for the immediate future at least.

Harris has tweeted that she'd give up her AFLW wage to employ a person to monitor online abuse and has called on governing body the AFL to block people who make discriminatory comments from its social media accounts.

Speaking before the death of English television presenter Caroline Flack , which led to the #BeKind hashtag being used on social media, Harris adds: ""It's a pretty messed up online world.

""It's a generational issue. It'll be weeded out in a while when young people come through with the understanding that it's not acceptable to be doing these things.""

Harris (R) fights againt Janay Harding on November 22, 2019.

Her parents, Harris admits, struggle to stoically react to the abuse she continues to receive online.

""They live a plane trip away so (last year) was hard, especially for mum, especially when it was all unfolding as all she wanted to do was get on the plane and make sure I was alright,"" Harris says.

""And all dad wanted to do was go and pay a visit to the people who were making these comments and I guess the rest is best left unsaid.""

Even before that kick was immortalized in bronze in Melbourne's bustling Federation Square, Harris warned her mum not to go online.

""I said to her 'please don't read the comments that are going to be online' because I knew people wouldn't take the time to consider that this statue is about much more than just me,"" Harris says.

""Particular people who didn't take the time to understand what the statue meant were hellbent on saying I didn't deserve this statue. I know I don't deserve a statue as a footballer, but this scenario deserves a statue for a pivotal moment in time that has helped people.""

Harris will forever be known for that photograph, but though only 22 she is not burdened by the responsibility that comes with influence.

""I often get young people who have experienced bullying online messaging me and they've said specifically that I've been the one who's helped them actually call it out, or help their friends call it out,"" she says.

""Bullying online is so bad that young people are committing suicide, which is horrific, so if I can give someone confidence to feel a little bit better about themselves, I will do everything to do that because you just don't know what could've happened otherwise.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
261,‘My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands... he had to dig the grave himself.’,"How one soccer club is helping educate fans on the horrors of the Holocaust

Anti-Semitism ‘My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands... he had to dig the grave himself.’

(CNN) — Avram Grant remembers the screaming.

It came nearly 50 years ago when Grant, then a teenager, first fully began to grasp the horrors that his father, Meir, had been forced to endure during the Holocaust.

“When I was 15 years old, I was sitting on the balcony of my home with my friend and I heard screaming and shouting,” Grant, the former Chelsea coach, told CNN.

“I had never heard anything like this, not even in Hitchcock movies,” adds Grant, referring to the legendary filmmaker.

“It was a shock for me. My father was shouting, I will never forget it. I said to my mum: ‘Mum, what is happening?’ I saw she was very calm and she touched him and he went back to sleep.

“I remember this day because I took a decision to realize how from this hell came such an optimistic and happy guy. I am telling you that I will never forget it.”

In 1941, Grant’s father fled Nazi-occupied Poland at the age of 13 along with the rest of his family before being exiled in northern Russia, where temperatures plunged to minus 40 degrees Celsius. Only Meir and his brother survived.

“My father buried his parents and sister with his bare hands … he had to dig the grave himself,” Grant said.

“He was 13. This was all because of hatred. That’s why I am always here to speak about it. Always.”

Grant is not only committed to telling his father’s story, but also to educating the next generation. That’s why he has embraced a campaign led by Chelsea, the club he once managed, aimed at eradicating anti-Semitism from soccer and society.

“When you get to my age, you realize there will be nobody left to tell the younger generation firsthand what happened. That’s why it is so important because we are coming to the end of the Holocaust survivor era.”

Grant’s reservations appear well placed.

Lack of Holocaust knowledge

The results of CNN’s 2018 investigation into anti-Semitism in Europe unearthed a number of shocking statistics on the subject of Holocaust education, with a third of Europeans in the poll saying they knew just a little or nothing at all about the Nazis systematic killing of six million Jews.

The outlook was similarly bleak in the US.

A survey carried out on behalf of the Claims Conference in 2018 found that 11% of American adults were not sure they’d ever heard of the Holocaust, rising to one in five millennials. Nearly half of the millennials surveyed could not name a single concentration camp, and 45% of the American adults questioned failed to do so.

In early May, Grant led a delegation from Chelsea and MLS team New England Revolution to take part in “March of the Living,” in which participants were taken on a guided tour of Auschwitz and learned about the systematic mass murder of Europe’s Jewish communities.

The visit was part of Chelsea’s highly respected “Say No to Anti-Semitism” campaign, which was launched in January 2018 under the leadership of club owner Roman Abramovich.

It was in November 2017 that Abramovich, who is Jewish, began discussions with the club’s board about a concerted campaign to fight anti-Semitism.

He was perturbed by the number of anti-Semitic incidents that had taken place across Europe and was eager to take a stand.

It was also an opportunity to educate the club’s supporters on a subject that those who watched the team in the 1970s and 1980s would have been all too aware of, given the anti-Semitic songs and chants that used to be heard at games.

Auschwitz chants

Ivor Baddiel, a Jewish Chelsea supporter, said he stopped attending games temporarily in the 1970s after hearing chants of “Sieg Heil” from a section of fellow supporters and seeing anti-Semitic literature sold outside the stadium.

Particularly vivid are his memories from games against Tottenham, one of Chelsea’s London rivals, that historically has a large following from the Jewish community.

Baddiel says Tottenham fans were often targeted by anti-Semitic abuse with songs such as “Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz” and hissing noises mimicking the sound of the gas chambers used by the Nazis during the Holocaust.

Baddiel also recalls the first time he heard the word “Yid,” a derogatory word for Jew, at a game. At the time, the word was also being used by Tottenham supporters, who wanted to reclaim the word from the racists, and instead, in their view, wear it as a badge of honor.

Even today, some Tottenham supporters refer to themselves as ‘“Yiddos” and the “Yid Army,” despite calls from Jewish groups to stop.

Though shocked by the nature of the anti-Semitic abuse, Baddiel, later resumed attending games.

He has made two videos on anti-Semitism, one focusing specifically on the “Y-word” and the other for Chelsea’s current campaign, both of which he hopes will help educate the public.

“Absurd as it sounds, those guys in the pub who are singing, ‘Spurs are on their way to Auschwitz,’ I think you could even question whether they realize they are being anti-Semitic,” Baddiel said.

“They think they’re being anti-Tottenham.

“I think a lot of people didn’t know it was a racist word for Jews and just thought it was about Tottenham fans.”

Fighting back

Today, Chelsea is one of the most proactive sporting organizations in tackling anti-Semitism, and its “Say No to Anti-Semitism” campaign has already won praise from both inside and outside football.

The club has taken supporters to Auschwitz-Birkenau to educate them about the horrors of the Holocaust, has invited survivors to speak to players and staff about their experiences, and is raising money to help fund a new Holocaust exhibition at London’s Imperial War Museum.

Neil Beard, a Chelsea supporter who attended his first game in 1970, believes the club has helped fans become better equipped to fight against anti-Semitism by providing educational programs and taking them on trips to concentration camps.

Beard, who visited Auschwitz last year with his two teenage children, and also attended a talk by a Holocaust survivor organized by the club in London, says the work Chelsea is doing is having a hugely positive effect.

“I feel we came back as advocates ready to tackle anti-Semitism, particularly where it’s done casually and through ignorance and people think it’s funny,” Beard told CNN.

“It’s not funny. We really need to take it seriously. It’s obviously a global issue with the rise of fascism but as Chelsea supporters and for the club I think we’ve come a long way because it’s now unacceptable and embarrassing among Chelsea supporters to sing some of the songs that were sung during the 1980s, 1990s and even up to today.

“Listening to a survivor had a huge impact on me, trying to imagine yourself in that position and that was harrowing to think you could have found yourself there in that kind of hell. It was so powerful.”

The Chelsea Foundation runs equality training workshops in 75 schools across the UK and ran sessions for hundreds of children in the lead-up to the team’s arrival in Boston for the club’s game against New England Revolution in a contest arranged to raise money for groups tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination.

Bruce Buck, Chelsea’s chairman, insists that while instances of anti-Semitism at the club’s games remain a “very small problem but an important problem” compared to 30 years ago, there will be no letup in the fight against Jew hatred.

He cites the training of stewards in identifying anti-Semitic behavior and the use of CCTV as key aides in tracking down those responsible.

“We’ve come a long way, society has come a long way, but there’s still a problem and I don’t underestimate the problem,” Buck told CNN.

“We are only dealing with the overt incidents and not dealing with those behind the screen and that’s where the other aspect I think of our project, the education part, dealing with that, trying to deal with what’s below the surface.”

Chelsea has cracked down on instances of racism by its fans already this season. Four fans were suspended for appearing to racially abuse Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling last December, while three supporters were barred from entering a Europa League game against Slavia Prague after a video on social media allegedly showed them abusing Liverpool’s Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah.

“We all understand the power of football, the reach of football, it’s extraordinary,” Buck added. “As an American, we think of ourselves as the biggest sports fans in the world and maybe we are, but we don’t have the attachment to our club that you do in the UK which is cradle to grave, whichever club your father supports, you support, and it’s unique. I think it’s true in continental Europe too. So that attachment gives them a loyalty and gives us an opportunity to education.”

'Could take an entire generation to correct properly'

Chelsea’s work has already been commended by sections of the local Jewish Community as well as UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.

Mirvis believes the role of education, which Chelsea is keen to emphasize as part of its strategy, is key to tackling anti-Semitism though he concedes there is no quick fix. “It could take an entire generation to correct properly,” he told CNN of the fight against anti-Semitism.

“Chelsea is leading the field here and it’s huge congratulations to them. I think the most significant thing Chelsea has done is to acknowledge that there is a problem. That’s very much to their credit. They have taken some concrete and constructive steps.

“It’s an enormous challenge. I think education, the concept, needs to be repeated again and again, together with genuine attempts. Our problem is that we are playing catch up when we are dealing with adults who are already in the stadium. They’ve been conditioned to some degree by their society to think in a certain way and find certain elements of conduct within their comfort zone.”

“When you are talking about changing opinions you need thought leaders, you need influencers.”

Karen Pollock, head of the Holocaust Educational Trust in London, told CNN it had been “humbling” to see Chelsea committing itself to fighting anti-Semitism with direction coming from the very top of the club and being embraced by staff and players alike.

“Footballers are role models for so many and their words and actions have such an impact,” Pollock said.

“Their positive message of inclusion and tolerance is vital in tackling prejudice and hate.”

Pittsburgh

For Chelsea, its arrival in the US could scarcely have been more timely.

An annual report published in May by the Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic incidents in the US remained near historic levels in 2018 after surging the previous year.

According to the latest figures from the ADL, 2018 was the third-highest year on record for assault, harassment and vandalism against Jews since it began tracking such incidents in 1979.

There were a total of 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the country, according to the report. This includes the 11 people killed during the October 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US.

These numbers are down slightly from the 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, the ADL said.

The decision to visit the US last month and hold a charity match against New England Revolution was made in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack. Both Abramovich and Revolution owner Robert Kraft had already expressed their desire to work with one another on tackling anti-Semitism, but according to Buck, Pittsburgh was the catalyst for the charity match.

Both Abramovich and Kraft pledged to donate $1 million to the charity fund, with a further $2 million being raised through gate receipts. The $4 million pot will be split between 15 different organizations tackling anti-Semitism and discrimination including the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

'Heroes'

Elan Carr, the US special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism, told CNN that while the attack in Pittsburgh and one at a synagogue in Poway, California, have recently left the Jewish community on edge, programs such as the one deployed by Chelsea and New England Revolution could play a key part in educating future generations on the dangers of anti-Semitism.

“When you are talking about changing opinions you need thought leaders, you need influencers – and athletes are influencers in a way no one else can be. These guys are heroes to kids from rural farmlands to cities, they are adored and worshipped. To have athletes who are so influential stand up and fight for decency and justice, and take positions and say ‘no’ to this scourge of anti-Semitism, a human sickness, and for athletes to say that is unacceptable, that is a game changer,” Carr told CNN.

“This example of what is happening and what Chelsea and New England are doing is a model that can truly change the world,” he added.

'Big power'

Such a responsibility is not lost on the players. Born in Brazil to parents who both worked as teachers, defender David Luiz told CNN that the morals instilled in him during his childhood have helped him become more aware of discrimination within society.

“Football has big, big power to do it and we have to use it in the right way,” Luiz told CNN of the sport’s role in bringing about positive social change.

“I think we are examples for many people around the world and we have to use this power in the right way to make the real difference.

“If you go to the maternity unit you don’t see one baby with a bad vibe. The babies are good, they are cute. It’s the pollution of the world and the system that makes people think in different ways.”

Luiz was part of the squad that visited the New England Holocaust memorial in Boston and also took part in education workshops with local schoolchildren.

On the final day of the tour, he played a part in Chelsea’s 3-0 win at Gillette Stadium with 25,000 fans lending their support to the game dubbed “Final Whistle on Hate.”

Abramovich flew to Boston to watch the game alongside Kraft and visited the locker room afterward.

'I will keep speaking'

For Grant, it was the final event of a trip that had brought the scourge of anti-Semitism to the forefront of the sporting agenda and gave hope to those working to tackle it each and every day.

262,"NBA: ""Hoop Dreams"" basketball documentary still relevant in 25th year","(CNN) When Dwyane Wade was a 12-year-old shooting jumpers on the playgrounds of Chicago, a movie came out that would help navigate him through his future Hall of Fame career.

Released in 1994, ""Hoop Dreams"" shadowed the bumpy fortunes of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two inner-city Chicago youths dreaming of NBA stardom.

Wade's path to the Final Four with Marquette and championships with the Miami Heat would be lined with the same challenges faced by Agee and Gates, including the pressures of injury and young parenting, and the avoidance of drugs and gun violence.

Twenty-five years since its premier, ""Hoop Dreams"" still impacts Wade. ""I watched it many times, and it resonated with me because we all have hoop dreams,"" the recently retired three-time NBA champion tells CNN.

""Growing up in Chicago you struggle,"" he adds, ""I look at ""Hoop Dreams"" and I can see myself in those individuals at the time.""

Film critics like the late Roger Ebert lauded the three-hour documentary f or exposing a side of America rarely depicted at the time: A class system stacked against the poor, coinciding with rising corruption in youth basketball.

Filmmakers Steve James (left), Peter Gilbert (center) and Fred Marx worked on a very thin budget until three years into ""Hoop Dreams,"" when they were able to secure enough funding for the project.

So what has changed since then?

College basketball is coming off a thrilling season, but faces intense scrutiny as a second corruption trial involving shady figures and illicit payments around the sport unravels in court. Meanwhile, Agee and Gates remain close -- bonded not just by their fame from ""Hoop Dreams,"" but two devastating murders in their families.

""You can't script this stuff,"" says Gates, 47, a youth basketball coach in San Antonio, Texas, to CNN. ""Our stories continue to (overlap) like that, because he lost Bo and we lost Curtis.""

Gates' brother Curtis, a former high school star who flamed out, and Agee's father Bo were both featured on screen. Curtis was shot in 2001, reportedly in a dispute over a woman, while Bo - whose redemption from crack addiction and jail time was a seminal part of the film - was killed in a robbery three years later.

""It was very heartbreaking,"" adds Agee, who still lives in the West Side of Chicago, not far from where he grew up. ""It's so eerie that me and William always say ""Hoop Dreams"" was a gift and a curse, and we both lost people that played a big part of our lives.

""And then for both of us not to make the NBA, you know, that eeriness, that gift and a curse is there.""

Though neither athlete played in the NBA, both received college scholarships -- no small feat coming from the dire housing projects they grew up in.

Agee, 46, who attended Arkansas State, went on to play professionally in the now-defunct USBL and had a stint with the Harlem Globetrotters. He then turned to acting, with small parts in a film and commercials.

Agee remains tied to ""Hoop Dreams,"" which provides his motivational speaking platform in schools, and still inspires viewers to send warm messages from places as far off as Australia and China. He also sells apparel inspired by the film, including a throwback jersey from his school days.

Gates was the more heralded of the two, receiving interest from top college basketball programs and a grant to attend the prestigious St. Joseph's high school -- the same school that is shown releasing Agee, seemingly for not playing well enough as a freshman.

But Gates blew out his knee at 16, then rushed back to the court after surgery and reinjured it. Though he played at Marquette University, the injury crippled his pro potential.

""For me, it's bittersweet on many levels,"" says Gates about the film which he has not watched in over 16 years. ""It was a constant reminder of what could have been and what didn't happen, and also a reminder that Curtis is no longer here to hear his voice.""

Nevertheless, he looks back on ""Hoop Dreams"" as a ""life turning situation,"" one that led to an allegiance with Michael Jordan, who invited him to pickup games before his comeback with the Washington Wizards. (An injury derailed Gates' own tryout with the Wizards, however.)

""It has opened doors,"" he says. ""It has done things that I never thought would happen in my life.""

'The first reality show'

What began as a short film idea from director Steve James and producer Frederick Marx to shoot Chicago playground basketball in 1987 with a budget of $2,000 quickly took on greater ambitions.

The pair hired Peter Gilbert as a cinematographer (later added as a producer), and the trio followed Gates and Agee on and off for nearly five years. With 250 hours of footage to edit, the production took seven years in total, eventually raising the $750,000 necessary for completion.

When it was finally released in 1994, ""Hoop Dreams"" went viral, though the term had not yet been coined. It was nominated for best film editing at the Oscars, but snubbed for best documentary and picture, which had critics like Ebert up in arms.

""I've actually gotten way more mileage personally as a filmmaker out of not being nominated than I ever would have by getting nominated,"" says James, who stays in contact with Agee and Gates. ""Over the years a lot more people seem to be upset on our behalf than I was personally.""

By the time it ended its theatrical run, ""Hoop Dreams"" became the then-highest grossing documentary of all time, paving the way for hundreds of sports documentaries and streaming series currently on air.

""I call it the first reality show,"" says Gates. ""I think it was groundbreaking.""

Gates' enrollment in Marquette was mirrored exactly 10 years later by Wade, who also struggled to qualify academically for an NCAA scholarship and sat out his first year for academic reasons, the university confirmed.

Wade shared other similarities with both Agee and Gates, including feeling the pressure to rush back to action after knee injury which required surgery at Marquette. Though the operation was successful, Wade later said it led to complications as a pro.

""I watched it when I was at Marquette from a different (angle), knowing that (Gates) was staying in the same dorm that I was standing in,"" says Wade, who -- also like Gates -- was caring for a child (son Zaire) while in college.

Wade was separated from his mother Jolinda at a young age when she succumbed to drugs , leading to spells in jail. Like Agee's father Bo, she turned to religion after getting clean, now serving as a church minister.

""Obviously, I was able to make it,"" but there are challenges, he adds. ""What I learned at the time is you learn a lot about other people sharing their story.""

William Gates was a 17-year-old high school junior when his daughter Alicia was born.

'Controlled corruption'

Rewatching ""Hoop Dreams"" 25 years later lends perspective to how fast top college recruits are forced to grow up, and how much is at stake early on.

Gates' daughter was born when he was 17, during his junior year of high school. Trying to be a father and student while rehabilitating from two knee surgeries to make it as the next Isiah Thomas -- the former St Joe's and NBA star who makes a cameo in the movie -- became too much to bear.

By the movie's final scene, with his passion for the game already waning, Gates remarks, ""When somebody says, 'When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me,' I should say to them, 'Well if I don't make it, you don't forget about me.""

It's no wonder he needed a break from the sport by his third year at Marquette.

""I didn't feel like a 19 or 20 year-old-kid, I felt like a kid who had been working 10 to 12 years at a job,"" Gates says, estimating that basketball practice and travel would take up to 60 hours a week in college. ""I had a lot on my plate.""

Agee had his own growing up to do, with his academics thrown into disarray after his brief spell at St Joe's, followed by Bo walking out and his mother Sheila losing her job.

In one scene, Sheila cannot pay her electricity bill and the family is left without power, while a clearly humiliated Agee broods at the camera.

(The filmmakers pitched in to get the power back on, leaving that detail out of the film. ""We didn't want to look self-serving, but we felt an obligation to do that much for them,"" says James.)

Agee transferred to Marshall High, leading the team on an improbable city championship and state semifinal run.

In recent years the public high school has been rocked by gun violence , leaving seven former basketball players dead and two paralyzed, including Agee's ex-teammate Shawn Harrington.

""I didn't let St. Joe's defeat me; I didn't let my neighborhood and my environment pull me in to gain drugs, carrying the guns -- that whole lifestyle,"" Agee reflects.

It helped that the teenagers had the right people on their sides. Gates and Agee admit they were given cash during their basketball ascent by the likes of so-called street agents, drug dealers and university affiliates who often helped promising players.

In ""Hoop Dreams"" Agee pays for Air Jordan gear at a store with money received from drug pushers. While at Arkansas State, he says a ""big street pharmacist"" whose team he played for in a high school summer league bought him a car.

""That was part of the deal,"" says Gates of being offered gifts from universities as a highly touted recruit, before committing to Marquette. ""It was like, 'Hey, you need anything let us know.' And you let them know and they took care of stuff.

""Hey I need transportation, hey I need clothes, I need shoes. They figured out how to get it to you,"" he says. ""They did it through a friend of the program that you didn't even know was a friend of the program. That's the way it was.""

In response, Marquette said it ""is committed to the highest ethical standards for the recruitment and retention of our student-athletes,"" while Arkansas State said it had no knowledge of Agee's car purchase and that ""there are too many unknown variables to comment further about a relationship from approximately 25 years ago.""



Arthur Agee was recruited to play at St Joseph's prep school as an eighth grader. A year later he was asked to leave, and his parents were billed for tuition they struggled to pay for.

Somewhat fittingly, Gates is now a full-time coach in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), the collection of summer leagues that insiders say has replaced high school basketball as the launching pad for college prospects.

Among the players that have passed through Team Hoop Dreams are all three of Gates' sons, William Jr., a recent graduate of Houston Baptist University, Jalon, a junior guard at Houston Baptist, and Marques, currently in high school.

AAU has come under fire by an ongoing FBI investigation involving sneaker companies funneling money towards recruits to land at big university programs. The AAU told CNN it does not fund its teams, calling the situation an ""apparel company scandal, not an AAU scandal.""

""People are buying and selling players; it's a human trafficking market."" says Michael Sokolove, author of ""The Last Temptation of Rick Pitino,"" which sheds light on college basketball corruption.

Multiple federal investigations have led to guilty pleas from four college assistants on bribery charges, the conviction of an Adidas executive, and the firing of Pitino from Louisville.

Pitino maintains he had ""no knowledge"" of infractions during his tenure as Louisville's head coach. James Gatto, Adidas' former head of global sports marketing, is appealing his nine-month prison sentence for wire fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with a $100,000 offer to the father of a Louisville recruit.

With athletic wear companies paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to support top AAU programs, the potential to use them as a means to distribute money to the families of top players or an influential coach is high, says Sokolove.

""Some of this is laundered money. These teams can be used as pass through,"" he says, adding that the ultimate goal is to breed loyalty with players who become walking advertisements for the shoe companies on the court.

The stakes have become much higher to land top recruits like Gates was in the days of ""Hoop Dreams,"" notes Sokolove. ""There are more people with their hands in the cookie jar and the kids are largely pawns in this whole endeavor.""

In 2017 the NCAA surpassed $1 billion in revenue, mostly through TV rights, while top players like Zion Williamson of Duke are limited to a compensation of tuition, room and board with a modest stipend.

Like many around the sport, Gates thinks college players need to get paid. He suggests universities contribute $100,000 towards a ""graduation fund"" for the player if he stays in school four years ""to get prepared to live life.""

Gates sees the current NBA age requirement of 19 as an obstacle towards paying black athletes, calling it a ""controlled corruption"" not seen in mostly white sports like baseball, tennis, golf or soccer.

""The two sports that are heavily dominated by African-Americans, it seems like there is always an issue when it comes to money,"" he says. (The NFL enforces a three-year rule before most college football players can turn pro.)

NCAA president Mark Emmert told the Associated Press this month that the organization has ""serious issues which require serious change,"" but paying players will remain unlikely.

'Part of a bigger story'

Coinciding with the movie's anniversary, Gates and his wife Catherine just celebrated their 25th year of marriage. The eldest of their four children Alicia, who was born during filming, is 30 and works as a dental hygienist.

For years Gates would not allow his sons to watch all of ""Hoop Dreams,"" fearing the scenes of his injuries would spook them. He finally relented, though Will Jr underwent four knee procedures of his own in college.

Agee has fathered five children, with his youngest Devin a budding youth basketball player in his own right. Devin's mother Jennifer Genovesi stood by Agee in the wake of a 2017 arrest after a woman accused him of battery.

Agee was quick to call James -- who he refers to as an uncle -- to assure him of his innocence. The charges were dropped shortly afterward.

""I'm part of a bigger story in this film. I never want to bring any despair or negativity into the story,"" Agee says. ""He was like, 'We'll get through it together,' and that was good as that.""

""I feel like they know that I'm here for them,"" says James, the film's director.

The special bond between the parties involved in the film was reflected once ""Hoop Dreams,"" which was never expected to be a commercial success, caught fire. In a highly unusual step, Agee and Gates were made equal partners by the producers.

""They weren't just filmmakers,"" says Agee. ""They came in over a period of time and got to know me and my family, and then stayed in touch.""

Arthur Agee bought his mother Sheila a house with royalties earned from ""Hoop Dreams."" He now uses the film as material for his job in motivational speaking.

Gates and Agee first received nearly $200,000 each, and Agee promptly brought his parents a four-bedroom house in a suburb.

His mother, Sheila Agee, who was seen at the end of the movie graduating tops in her nursing class, relocated to Alabama in the wake of Bo's death.

After Curtis' murder, Gates was given an unlikely last shot at the NBA at age 29 with a tryout with the Chicago Bulls. But bad luck struck again when he caught the flu on the day of the workout.

""I said maybe God doesn't want me to play basketball,"" he reflects. ""That's when my ministry life began to open up.""

Gates received his master's in biblical studies and worked as a pastor at the Cabrini Green housing project he grew up in before settling in Texas.

He is thankful that Curtis got to meet Jordan before he was killed -- another imprint tied to his fame from the film.

""What came along with that was the responsibility to teach, educate, be a friend, have some compassion and show some understanding,"" Gates says.

""I've been very honored, privileged and grateful to be part of ""Hoop Dreams,"" he reflects. ""It's been super amazing to be a part of something that has withstood the test of time.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
263,Has the digital age changed football fans?,"(CNN) Sky Ouyang used to avidly follow Real Madrid, keeping up to date with how the La Liga club was doing from his Shanghai home.

A Real shirt from the 2008/09 season -- Cristiano Ronaldo's first campaign as a Real player -- was a prized possession. But then Ronaldo moved to Juventus and Ouyang's loyalties changed.

Focused flicked from Spain to Italy; to the back of the wardrobe went the Real shirt, in came Juventus merchandise, and immediately it was the Italian club the 23-year-old followed on every social media platform.

""I support Ronaldo first and foremost. The team isn't important, it's whoever he plays for,"" the social media executive, who first fell under the Portuguese's spell when Ronaldo was the young buck at Manchester United beguiling with step-overs and swerves, tells CNN Sport.

Ouyang is not alone in switching his allegiances to Juventus following Ronaldo's $117m summer transfer from a club with whom he established himself as one of the greatest to have played the beautiful game.

With 139m Instagram followers, 74m on Twitter and over 122m on Facebook, Ronaldo is the most followed footballer on social media.

Juventus was the fastest growing European club online in China last month, the number of followers ballooning at a rate which has been described as unprecedented.

Perhaps it should be of no surprise that five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, a footballer who has only one equal in Lionel Messi for comparable talent and fame, attracts such zealous following in a country where success and celebrity is cherished.

""There hasn't been an incident like this where there's been fans moving from one team to another or deciding to choose and follow a second team. This is probably the largest shift we've ever seen in China,"" says Tom Elsden, senior client manager at Shanghai-based digital marketing and investment company Mailman.

""In the same period, Real Madrid have lost followers so there's been a direct correlation between Juventus growing and Real Madrid losing followers.""

But the tidal wave of followers which came Juventus' way once it signed one of the world's most famous sportsmen was not merely a Chinese phenomenon.

The Bianconeri has gained 3.5m Instagram followers over the last month, while Juventus' engagements, impressions and followers on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have also rocketed.

Does Ronaldo's digital influence, his power to change a fan's allegiance, mean the nature of football fandom has changed?

If Ronaldo, Neymar and Messi all have a bigger social media following than their clubs, is this the era where the sport's biggest names garner more devotion than the teams for whom they play?

Simon Chadwick, professor of sports enterprise at Salford University, says the cult of celebrity has changed the way football fans around the world associate with teams and players.

""There is the emergence of celebrity culture over the last 15 to 20 years in a way that didn't exist in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s,"" he tells CNN Sport.

""We're now more interested in celebrities than perhaps we are teams and that's a characteristic of not just football and sport but of life in general.""

George Best is regarded as the first British sportsman to be accorded pop star status.

Star footballers have been hero-worshiped since the beginning of the 20th Century and for decades have attempted to capitalize on their popularity.

At the peak of his footballing powers in the 1960s, former Manchester United winger George Best -- a man once dubbed the fifth Beatle -- famously appeared in an advert in the United Kingdom telling viewers that Cookstown bangers were ""the Best family sausages.""

But much has changed since those black and white days when one of the world's most celebrated players helped increase sales in sausages for a family butcher.

Advertising campaigns are more sophisticated, footballers' brands are carefully cultivated, major clubs and their players are lucrative businesses and, crucially, there is the world wide web.

The internet, said Stephen Hawking, has connected us ""like neurons in a giant brain"" and has allowed players and clubs to communicate directly with fans, while in this globalized world almost everything is accessible, from live streaming a match to buying snazzy boots.

If, as renowned journalist Arthur Hopcraft once wrote, football reflects the kind of community that we are then the sport as it is today, and those who follow it, are a reflection of an interconnected world.

Fans wear Ronaldo and Messi masks during the Russia 2018 World Cup.

""There's something in the way in which the social and digital environment has enabled fans to challenge the existing ways of being a fan and perhaps therefore it's breaking down the barriers to fandom that previously existed,"" says Chadwick.

""The role of social media is shaping people's associations and perceptions.

""For many younger people in particular they have less affiliation with a football team that's embedded in the town where they're from and more association with global icons.

""Those global icons can be Manchester United or Real Madrid, but at the same time those global icons can be Kylian Mbappe, Ronaldo or Paul Pogba.""

Teenager Mbappe's goals and blistering forward play helped France win the World Cup in Russia. The 19-year-old, like so many of Generation Z (those born in the '90s and 2000s), hasn't lived in a world without social media.

France forward Mbappe was named the best young player at Russia 2018.

""We've not heard much about brand France or the marketing potential of the French national team. What we've heard lots about is the commercial potential of brand Mbappe,"" says Chadwick.

""There is a focus on the individual and the marketing of those individuals is consistent with Generation Z and the way Generation Z consumes products and associates with brands.

""I don't think we understand Generation Z as well as we should right now. Do we know that Generation Z is even interested in football? Aren't they more interested in social media and filming each other?

""I would stand by my observation that Generation Z is interested in individuals and their point of engagement is around individuals and you see that through the emergence of vloggers and internet celebrities.""

'Portfolio fandom'

Then there is ""portfolio fandom"" as Chadwick puts it, a reference to fans who will support a number of teams, typically one from each major European league, reflecting ""the fluid and open way many of us lead our lives.""

Portfolio fandom has, to a certain extent, existed for decades. Ardent fans of one particular club will often have a soft spot for a team in a different division.

The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media. Michael Calvin

The popularity of the football program ""Football Italia"" which broadcast Serie A matches live on terrestrial TV in the UK in the 1990s helped make following the Italian top flight hipster cool before the word hipster had entered the popular lexicon. That was also, of course, before the English Premier League spread its tentacles across the globe.

Yet even two to three decades ago, the sight of a Barcelona shirt, let alone one with the Catalan club's star player Messi embossed on the back, was rare anywhere outside of the region.

These days seeing children playing in, for example, a Barcelona shirt is common in many neighborhoods around the world. The name on the back of that shirt is also often entirely predictable.

A Cuban boy wears a Barcelona shirt in Havana.

Boys wearing Real Madrid's and Manchester United jerseys sit on a bench in Skopje, Macedonia.

""You hear small anecdotes about kids who might not be Real Madrid fans but they're Cristiano Ronaldo fans,"" says Michael Calvin, an award-winning English sports journalist and author.

""The nature of fandom has changed, probably for the worst in terms of social media.""

Calvin is referring to the rise of Arsenal TV, a channel which has over 820,000 YouTube subscribers and 285,000 Twitter followers, and personifies how the digital age has given fans a platform to voice their opinions, be it for good or bad.

""I don't feel it's very healthy,"" adds Calvin. ""They've got every right to their opinion but it's an uneducated opinion in many cases.

""The whole phenomenon of fan TV where you get people basically expanding on their prejudices and condemning managers out of hand. I don't think that's a very welcome development.""

Millwall fans outside The Den before a Championship match.

In his latest book ""The State of Play,"" Calvin touches on Millwall, a London-based team in the second tier of English football which, like many of its stature, is not internationally supported.

Those who follow the Championship club do so because such devotion has been bequeathed from one generation to the next.

You're born into being a Millwall fan. With the working clubs it's a birthright. Michael Avery

Michael Avery supports the Lions, as did his father, his grandfather, and as do his two children.

""You're born into being a Millwall fan -- you don't think 'I'll start supporting them',"" Avery tells CNN Sport.

""You won't necessarily get someone who's 30 years old who's just got into football supporting Millwall.""

While the club is one promotion away from the riches of the Premier League, Avery says the majority of fans would not want to reach the promised land if it meant sacrificing the club's identity.

""Millwall prides itself on being a working-class club, a family club. It's never been known for big money transfer, or big wages,"" he explains.

""I do feel 95% of the fan base have heritage in the area. With the working clubs it's a birthright. As lovely as it would be to see Millwall make the Premier League, we don't want to sell that identity as a working-class football club just to make it to the top division.""

This week it was revealed that more than half of clubs in the Premier League could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the 2016-17 season because of the league's bumper broadcast deal.

In 2018, Deloitte said the majority of Europe's 20 richest clubs earn no more than a fifth of their income from 'matchday revenues.'

Clubs are increasingly targeting a global audience by signing lucrative commercial deals and so it should be of no surprise that the way those teams are being consumed has changed.

St. Pauli fans hold aloft a flag with the club's recognizable symbol.

Ed Barrett is a Manchester United fan living in Germany. He also follows St. Pauli, a Hamburg-based football club in Germany's second tier which has not won any major titles but whose 29,500-capacity ground is almost always full.

The anti-establishment club has also developed a global following, with its the skull-and-crossbones symbol proving highly marketable.

""FC St Pauli has an image that allows them to exploit a market niche. As such, they went on a sponsor laden tour of the key US market during the summer. If that helps us pay the bills without increasing ticket prices or selling the stadium name, then that really doesn't bother me,"" Barrett tells CNN Sport.

""Likewise, online content or tours by United to gear towards casual fans in the Far East isn't a huge disadvantage to match-going fans. At worst, a minor irritation if you bother following the club on social media where some of the content seems far removed from the essence of the club.""

Fandom has as many layers as a trifle. It is also complex. Fans come in many guises and the extent of their devotion varies. Not that the supporters themselves seem too concerned about these developing intricacies.

""It's a different kind of fan,"" Millwall's Avery says of the disciples of the global icons.

""As much as Ronaldo and Messi are the iconic image, there's obviously an interest in the brand of football. It's just how times have changed.""

It is the clubs themselves, the global players who have chased new supporters, who are having to adapt the most.

""The formation of the Premier League helped to instigate a culture change not just in English football, but in world football more generally,"" says Chadwick.

""The old days, which we can refer to as pre-1992 before the Premier League, were very conventional. They were much simpler and what that therefore did was create not just one generation of fans but multiple generation of fans.

""But post-1992, a new generation of citizens and consumers began to emerge and obviously this is being driven by globalization and digitalization and so the world of football fandom is now much more complex that it was 20, 30, 40 years ago.

""When you begin to factor in Juventus trying to target fans in China through Ronaldo, you're not talking about old Juventus fans and young Juventus fans, but Chinese fans too.

""What football clubs are faced with is having to understand somewhat the Chinese, Europeans, Americans, Millennials, Generation X, Generation X. There are differences between urban and suburban viewers, men and women.

""For football clubs, which are relatively small organizations, understanding this complexity is a huge challenge for them.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
264,Eliud Kipchoge targets 'super human' marathon time to beat two-hour barrier,"London (CNN) Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge will once again attempt to become the first athlete to break the two-hour marathon barrier in an event being staged in London later this year.

Dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge , this race against the clock -- to be staged in late September or early October -- is being backed by Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire owner of chemical firm INEOS, which recently purchased British Cycling's Team Sky.

""It's human nature to push boundaries,"" said the INEOS 1:59 Challenge website. ""The drive to learn and achieve more is in our DNA. In Autumn this year Eliud Kipchoge, with support from INEOS, plans to redefine the limits of human achievement by breaking the last great barrier of modern athletics -- the two-hour marathon.""

Last week Ratcliffe and INEOS were accused by environmental protesters of ""sportswashing"" -- using sport to enhance reputation -- an accusation the Briton completely rejects.

Speaking to reporters ahead of cycling's Tour de Yorkshire, Ratcliffe took aim at those who criticized his company's fracking project, claiming the majority of environmental groups he has met are ""ignorant"" of the process, adding it remains a cheap source of energy.

Eliud Kipchoge is expected to take part in the event in September or October 2019.

265,Gay Bowl attracts NFL sponsors and touches lives,"Denver, Colorado (CNN) Magic, it seemed, was possible any time Dorien Bryant touched the ball.

Electric runs like the 98-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown in front of 108,000 at Penn State, or the 95-yard score at home against Northwestern, or the touchdown catches of 53 and 41 yards against Indiana State peppered his college football career.

Bryant left Purdue University in 2007 as the school's career leader in all-purpose yards, setting multiple Big Ten conference records before signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Yet just a year later, the playmaker was out of football, walking away from an offer from the Tennessee Titans and reportedly ignoring a call from the Dallas Cowboys.

""I came out when I was 24 or 25,"" Bryant tells CNN Sport of his decision to live openly as a gay athlete about a year after ending his NFL pursuit. ""It was more of my choice, I didn't try and push it.""

""I never wanted to be a figurehead for a movement; I don't want to be that guy.""

Dorien Bryant set records in four years at Purdue University, but walked away from an NFL contract to live an openly gay life.

For the first time since childhood, Bryant, who also ran track at Purdue, took a break from sports and focused on himself. Football became an afterthought.

""It was either football or being able to live my life the way I want to live my life, and I'm happier than I ever was,"" he says. ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Now Bryant is back in the sport as his true self, featured as the go-to receiver for the 2017 champion New York Warriors at Gay Bowl, the annual tournament of the National Gay Flag Football League.

Fifty-seven teams from 22 cities battled it out in 100-degree Denver weather last month, in seven-on-seven matches that provided a remarkable level of athleticism for a recreational league.

Bryant is one of at least seven players on the Warriors with college football experience, recruited by teammate Wade Davis, a former Tennessee Titans signee who won an NFL Europe title with the Berlin Thunder.

""The competition has progressively gotten better,"" says Davis, 41, a figurehead in the league who takes the Warriors' quest to repeat as Gay Bowl titleholders seriously. ""The other teams have had to figure out how to get better players and better coaching.""

""I'm happier than I ever was,"" said Byrant (#9). ""I love football, but if I can't be me then it's not worth it.""

Over the past 18 years Gay Bowl has grown from a three-team tournament played in the dirt field of a Hollywood high school to a three-day event held in rotating cities boasting 35 sponsors, including United Airlines, Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels and UPS.

Rosters represent a mix of races, genders and sexual orientations -- and welcome straight players, though their numbers are capped by a quota.

Everything is well organized, from the shuttle buses, to the singing of the Canadian and American anthems, to referees in striped uniforms who sound a lot like their NFL counterparts.

Games are governed by a 57-page rule book , and formed by two 30-minute halves, with tackling replaced by the removal of an opponent's flag belt.

""I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would get this big,"" says co-founder Jim Buzinski, ""but now it's so institutionalized. Cities are bidding for this.""

Honolulu, in fact, recently beat out bids from Austin and Toronto for the 2020 games, while New York will host its second Gay Bowl next year.

The New England Patriots were sponsors of last year's Gay Bowl in Boston, with owner Robert Kraft speaking at the closing ceremony. This year the Denver Broncos made a financial contribution and worked with organizers to boost the tournament's reach.

""This shows that an issue the NFL probably would have avoided at some point in the past, thinking it was controversial, is now so accepted in mainstream that it seemed a no-brainer to be a part of,"" says Buzinski, who also co-founded the news service Outsports. ""It is so routine that no one cares.""

""These are all football players and football fans, which is kind of a good business decision. It shows the progress that has been made.""

For most of the 1,000 or so participants of Gay Bowl, the long weekend represents a reunion of friends and a celebration of football -- the sport they love, which in many ways shaped their lives.

""The majority of my friends in DC are in the league,"" says James Santos of the Washington Generals, a former Air Force enlistee who would go on to win this tournament playing receiver in his fifth Gay Bowl.

""I have friends who met in the league who got married. I've been in weddings, birthday parties, and one funeral. They are like my family outside my immediate family.""

Flag football was also a means for Santos and his sister, who plays in the female league, to come out to their conservative church-going parents from Texas.

""How my parents grew up, it was really frowned upon,"" he says. ""You were just not considered normal, you were considered weak and a sissy.""

""That's just not the case at all, so for them to see that type of contact and passion ... it's just eye opening."" Santos' parents now attend their games often and ""are really into it.""

""These are like everyday people that love sports,"" he says, adding that flag football helped dispel damaging stereotypes sometimes associated with the LGBT community.

What would do wonders for the perception of gay male athletes, Santos says, is to be represented by a prominent pro.

""Like Jackie Robinson for black people, or Billy Jean King for women, we need an equivalent of someone like that to come out -- a stud athlete,"" says Santos, who is black. ""It would be okay. They are not going to lose their jobs.""

Gay Bowl participants take a knee during the singing of the American national anthem on the opening morning of the tournament, September 14, 2018.

Bryant agrees. ""Sheer numbers tell you there are a few LGBT players in the NFL and in the NBA as we speak,"" he says, ""it's just that those guys are afraid.""

The former Purdue standout wonders how things may have turned out if his shot at the NFL happened now instead of a decade ago. He points to Arizona State University signing openly gay high school football player My-King Johnson as a step forward.

""There is more of a conversation like that in professional sports now,"" he says. ""It's slow, but it's progress.""

It appears that football's locker room culture -- which nearly drove former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan to suicide before coming out -- must evolve for a gay superstar to emerge.

Bryant's Warriors teammate, former San Diego State strong safety Shaun Rogers, says his personal life took a backseat until his athletic scholarship ended.

""Playing football is always like, how is my team going to respond? How is everyone going to respond?"" says the 35-year-old brand innovator with heavily inked arms.

""I don't want nobody to feel uncomfortable about the situation, so I kind of just suppressed it,"" he adds. ""After college, I just became more open with it.

""There was more freedom, I didn't have to worry about my teammates -- even though they were my friends. I just didn't have to be around that culture.""

Gay Bowl XVIII athletes congregated at a welcoming party at a rooftop bar in Denver, Colorado.

Alongside Bryant, Davis and Rogers are Stephan Benjamin, a 6-foot 4-inch, 211-pound former wide receiver at American International College, captain Preston Roberts Jr. from Worcester Polytechnic, and quarterback Chris Allison from Columbia University.

Gelling with the LGBTQ league's ethos of inclusion, Roberts and Allison are two of the Warriors' five allotted straight players, with no more than three allowed on the field at once.

Both prefer to play in New York's gay flag football league, rather than the ragtag games they were a part of in the city. ""I can't think of a straight league that is on this level doing this type of stuff,"" says Roberts.

""This is legit,"" says Allison. ""First off, everyone's got a jersey. Then you've got the tents (shielding resting players from the sun), you've got websites, you've got first aid here. Everyone's got a plan of action.""

""A lot of these leagues we've played in have been ad hoc, you've seen fistfights,"" he adds, noting that in the gay leagues ""people get a little chippy from time to time with competitiveness. But if there is a fight, you're gone. It's not acceptable.""

During his first practice, the quarterback felt ""a different vibe"" straight away. ""Everyone was super friendly with a lot of camaraderie, and so I said 'Why don't we give it a go?'""

Roberts says joining the New York Gay Football League -- which welcomes ""straight allies"" on its website -- was by way of an understanding with Davis.

""He's taught me a lot about this league and about LGBT, so he's only expanded (my mind),"" he says, ""but he wouldn't have invited me to the league if he didn't think that this is something that I could become a part of.""

""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough.""

Warriors captain Preston Roberts Jr. (right), who is straight, credited the league for educating him on the LGBT community. ""If you're a gay participant and you invite a straight player, you probably trust them to be open enough,"" he said.

It's the opening morning of Gay Bowl XVIII and players on the vast green field on the outskirts of Denver are slow to get into a rhythm. Maybe a few too many carried on at the welcoming rooftop party the night before.

Bryant, who doubles as a personal trainer for budding college prospects and a bartender in New York, is used to playing on little sleep. ""I get off work on Saturday at like 5 a.m. and we'll practice at like 9 a.m.,"" he says.

Boasting a considerable size advantage, the Warriors dispose of their opponents convincingly.

If anyone on the field is keeping track of which three straight players are playing for each team, it isn't apparent. Enforcement has always been based on an honor system, and by all accounts it works.

""I'm not going to say it's never come up,"" says Roberts of the Warriors' inclusion of high-caliber straight players, ""but relatively speaking, it doesn't. There is a rule for it, but it's not a thing.""

Playing in his fourth Gay Bowl, the former Ivy Leaguer Allison is one of several straight quarterbacks in the league, because -- just like in the NFL -- good flag football quarterbacks are hard to find.

""I'm sure there are a few people who are frustrated about it,"" he says. ""There is definitely a debate there. You have to balance it out and make sure we come to some middle ground where everyone can be happy.""

Buzinski explains why a quota system was implemented after he founded the Los Angeles league. ""We didn't want a situation where a 'gay team' would have 75 percent straight players, and they were the best straight players in high school or college, and they would be ringers.""

""People said, 'Well isn't that discriminatory?' No. You can play flag football in LA or any city in multiple leagues, so they weren't being deprived of an opportunity,"" he notes, adding that he never saw ""a serious violation.""

""People policed themselves."" Besides, ""there was no way we could really test for it,"" he says.

""There were some players that people would swear were straight, and then their boyfriend would show up.""

Joe Cooper of the Denver Summit, who was honored by the league as a Hall of Fame inductee this year, sums up the consensus.

""At the end of the day, you have a lot of gay men who say 'I don't care if he's straight or not, I'm still going to whoop his ass on the football field.'""

Not to be outdone, women have featured prominently at the Gay Bowl since their inclusion seven years ago.

""We're very, very competitive, specifically when it comes to sports,"" says the Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins, who has played on six championship teams. ""We can be a bit brutal with each other.""

New to the city after finishing her tour with the Army, Rollins found flag football ""all encompassing,"" and even met her wife through the league.

""It's really been this amazing experience at an adult time in my life,"" she says. ""I never went to college, so I consider this to be like a college experience for me. I never had this comradery, this sports experience.""

The Denver Mile High Club's Aszur Rollins (right), who won her sixth Gay Bowl, says flag football is ""all-encompassing"" and met her wife through the league.

Before she transitioned to life as a woman, Kaylee Parker played wide receiver at South View High School in North Carolina, battling several top college prospects in the state.

The 38-year-old mechanical engineer moved to Phoenix in 2015 and began living full time as a woman, but missed the competition.

""Originally, I just wanted to play football,"" she says of finding her way onto the Phoenix Fahrenheit, ""and once I started playing, I ended up meeting a lot of cool people, and it's basically like my other family now.""

""It didn't matter to me if it was a straight league or a gay league, but it happened to be what I found.""

Coming from a Phoenix league that is open to all genders, Parker's gender identity has not been an issue. But the Fahrenheit's team captain and quarterback admits she has received some resistance as a trans athlete competing in the women's division of Gay Bowl.

""Everyone has their perspectives,"" she says, adding that flag football is more about finesse, catching skills, quickness and strategy, and less about brute strength. ""So I think that the physicality of it goes out the window.""

(Her sentiment is echoed by Bryant, whose Warriors took fifth place this year. ""It's about who's smart,"" he says. ""You can have the 12 best athletes in this tournament and line up and still lose."")

""I think about it a lot,"" Parker says. ""I wouldn't compete if it was a tackle league.""

The other competitors, she feels, are perfectly capable of facing her across the line of scrimmage. ""I would think that it would discredit a lot of women if I said I wouldn't play.""

Kaylee Parker played high school football in North Carolna before transitioning to life as a woman. The 38-year-old mechanical engineer says her flag football teammates in Phoenix are ""like my other family now.""

Perhaps the game is less physical than tackle football, but it certainly can be rough.

One Warriors player is examined for a possible torn tendon in his knee after the team's very first game, while an LA Express player grumbles to Bryant that he lost a toenail in a collision.

""He acts like I did it on purpose,"" Bryant shrugs to a teammate, after encouraging the player to go to the first aid tent. ""It will grow back.""

Bryant -- who at 33 still sports a six-pack and the unmistakable frame of a pro athlete -- admits he was at first taken aback by the level of play in the league, then checked himself. Was he stereotyping too?

""You know what, you are kind of (surprised) at first,"" he says. ""But then when you step back and think about it, why? Why are we surprised?

""Because they are gay men? Like, we can play,"" he says, eyebrows raised, head nodding. ""It is a recreational league, but we can play.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

That's the lowest score any player has carded on the first day of the six previous US Opens at Winged Foot, with the world No. 3 finishing one shot clear of Patrick Reed, Thomas Pieters and Matthew Wolff and two clear of Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood.

Thomas, 27, is looking to add to his sole major triumph at the 2017 PGA Championship.

""65 is fun no matter where you play, especially at Winged Foot,"" he told reporters.

""I was in a really good frame of mind, and I was focused. I just was sticking to my routine and playing every shot, as opposed to getting ahead of myself.

277,Lamine Diack: Former head of world athletics jailed for corruption,"(CNN) The former head of athletics' governing body, Lamine Diack, has been sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty on charges of corruption related to the Russian doping scandal, a Paris courthouse announced on Wednesday.

Diack, 87, was found guilty of soliciting $4.1 million (3.45 million euros) from athletes suspected of doping to cover up the allegations and allow them to continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

He was handed a four-year prison sentence on Wednesday, two of which are suspended, and fined $594,000 (500,000 euros).

The Senegalese was one of the most influential men in the sport and led the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now renamed World Athletics, from 1999-2015.

It is unclear whether he will spend any time in prison, given that he's been under house arrest in Paris since 2015.

The 28-year-old was sent off at the end of Le Classique for striking Marseille's Álvaro González as a full-scale brawl broke out in injury time that saw five players red carded.

His teammates Layvin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes were also given six and two-game bans respectively, while Marseille's Jordan Amavi received a three-game ban and Dario Benedetto a one-game ban.

Neymar and Paredes, who also both received a suspended sanction of an additional one-match ban, will be available to play again against Stade de Reims on September 27.

PSG's Angel Di Maria has also been summoned to a disciplinary hearing next Wednesday.

279,Gareth Bale looks for a fresh start as golden stay in Madrid turns sour,"(CNN) Since Gareth Bale joined Real Madrid for a then world record fee in 2013, only Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema have scored more goals for Los Blancos.

By every tangible metric, the Welshman's stay in the Spanish capital was a success; four Champions Leagues , two La Liga titles and one Copa del Rey, as well as multiple UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup wins.

Bale saved many of his 105 goals in Real for the biggest occasions, scoring the winner in two of those four Champions League finals and an impossible solo goal to win the 2014 Copa del Rey final against bitter rival Barcelona.

Those moments' strength, speed and spectacular acrobatics showcased the very best that Bale's game has to offer and more than repaid the $132.9 million fee Real paid Tottenham Hotspur for his services.

That his time in Madrid, then, has come to such an unhappy end, with Tottenham confirming a season-long loan deal on Saturda y, is a shame for all parties involved.

For Bale, he won't get the send-off that his accomplishments deserve and at perhaps any other club would have earned him legend status, while the fans, due to the animosity many hold towards him, will never truly get to enjoy the success he's brought them.

While there's no doubt Bale could have behaved differently at times, Real Madrid fans have a reputation of booing their own.

Gareth Bale scored a stunning winning goal to beat Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey final.

In recent times, not even club legends Ronaldo and Iker Casillas have been spared the jeers and whistles inside the stadium, giving some indication of the lack of support this fan base often provides.

Indeed, by the end of 2018 -- during the first somewhat barren spell this club had endured in the last seven years -- average attendances at the Bernabeu dwindled to 62,000, leaving almost 20,000 empty seats.

Regardless, there's no doubt Bale's antics on the substitute bench and infamous ""Wales, golf, Madrid. In that order"" flag while on international duty antagonized an already fickle fan base.

There will certainly be no love lost between Bale and the Spanish press, which has at times been relentless in its persecution of the Welshman. ""James and Bale, two other bad deals,"" wrote Sport newspaper.

""Florentino Pérez spent 191 million euros between the two signings and has barely recovered 13,"" it read. ""Nor have they succeeded in the field, where they showed flashes of their quality but did not reach Galacticos.""

If four Champions League titles in seven years cannot be defined as succeeding, then spare a thought for every other player that arrives at the club.

""Bale has cost Real Madrid 23,000 Euros per minute,"" wrote rival paper AS upon learning of his imminent departure. ""The club had to pay him €30 million last season for playing only 27% of the possible minutes,"" it read.

Wales celebrate with the infamous ""Wales. Golf. Madrid flag.""

Fresh start

Bale's loan move back to north London offers him a perfect opportunity to rekindle his career.

But now 31 and with a lengthy history of injuries, coupled with severely limited playing time in recent months, there are legitimate doubts as to how well Bale's body will hold up in the Premier League -- Spurs have reportedly prepared a month-long training plan in an attempt to get his body ready for the rigors of playing regularly competitive football once again.

Despite the lingering questions around his fitness, it's impossible not to view this as the ideal move for both Tottenham and Bale. There's no doubt the forward still possesses world class ability, something this Spurs side desperately needs.

After reaching the Champions League final in 2019, Tottenham struggled last season to bounce back from the disappointment and quickly sacked Mauricio Pochettino in favor of José Mourinho.

The Portuguese endured an inconsistent first season in charge but there were, at times, signs this squad could perhaps still reach the levels that saw it finish runner-up in both the Premier League and Champions League.

Jose Mourinho holds Gareth Bale during the Champions League quarter final in 2011.

After signing for Tottenham from Southampton in 2007, Bale gradually grew into the first team but it wasn't until three years later that he exploded onto the world stage. With Spurs 4-0 down and playing with 10 men, Bale scored a stunning hat-trick against Inter Milan at the San Siro, to announce himself as a star player in Europe.

While he may no longer possess all of that blistering pace, he unquestionably still has enough quality to give any defender in the Premier League trouble.

Mourinho has publicly expressed his admiration for Bale on a number of occasions and has been open about his attempts to sign him while he was in charge of Real Madrid. Their paths never crossed, with Bale joining the season after Mourinho left -- but eight years later Mourinho finally has his wish.

Perhaps more than anything, Bale just needs to find a home where he feels loved. He will certainly find that back in north London with a fan base that still adores him.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
280,"Gareth Bale: From dream start to nightmare end, Welshman's Real Madrid career turns sour","(CNN) When Gareth Bale arrived at Real Madrid in September 2013, for a then-world record fee, it looked to be a match made in heaven.

The forward was regarded as the next Galactico, the player to help Real through a golden period in the club's history and the man who would eventually fill Cristiano Ronaldo's shoes.

Bale has lived up to most of the lofty expectations heaped upon him, winning four Champions Leagues , a La Liga title, and the Copa del Rey.

But after six trophy-filled years in Spain, the 30-year-old is now being treated as a costly irritant: booed by his club's own fans and unwanted by his manager.

How did it all get so ugly and what next for a winger who was once the world's most expensive player?

During his first season in Spain, the Welshman scored the winning goals in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals, the latter a stunning individual effort that displayed the pace, power and skill that had convinced Real to part with $120 million.

In 2018 he scored what is widely regarded as the greatest goal in a Champions League final as he came off the bench to down Liverpool.

But fast forward to the present day and Real boss Zinedine Zidane -- back for his second spell in charge -- is having to deny accusations of disrespect from Bale's agent, who took umbrage with the Frenchman saying: ""We hope he leaves soon. It would be best for everyone.""

Bale didn't feature in Sunday's 3-1 pre-season defeat to Bayern Munich, though Zidane says that was the Welshman's decision. The relationship between player and manager appears to have broken down.

Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring a stunning solo goal to win the Copa del Rey final.

""I have not disrespected anyone,"" the Real Madrid coach told reporters ahead of Tuesday's match against Arsenal in Washington. ""The club is dealing with his departure. Period.

""The other day [against Bayern], Gareth didn't play because he didn't want to. He said the club was trying to negotiate his departure, and he didn't want to play because of that.

""Bale hasn't asked not to play tomorrow [Wednesday] ... so far. His situation is known by everyone and will not change. The club is going to do what they have to do with him.""

Bale came off the bench against Arsenal and scored to help Real Madrid come back from 2-0 to earn a draw, before missing a penalty in his team's victorious penalty shootout.

""He put in a good performance and I'm pleased for him,"" Zidane said. ""He played today, he wanted to and he did a good job. He wanted to be with us today, he trained normally and played the match.

""I make the decisions and he played one half. We'll have to see what happens. He's still here with us at this stage.

""Nothing has changed, you know the situation,"" he added.

Club legend?

Had Bale performed as he has done for the past six years at any other club, he would be revered as a legend -- but this is Real Madrid and its fans have earned a reputation.

When the going gets tough, the fans stop going -- or start booing.

By the end of 2018 -- during the first somewhat barren spell this club had endured in the last seven years -- average attendances at the Bernabeu dwindled to 62,000, leaving almost 20,000 empty seats.

Gareth Bale's relationship with manager Zinedine Zidane has reportedly deteriorated.

That Bale is set to depart Real to no great eulogy or grand farewell from either fans of manager should perhaps come as no surprise, either. After all, Real fans whistled at goalkeeper Iker Casillas, Madrid born and bred, towards the end of his 25-year association with the club.

Casillas had won every trophy there was to win -- three Champions Leagues, five league titles, a World Cup -- he was the club's captain and had made 725 appearances for his boyhood team, but aged 34 he departed with the relationship between him and Real soured.

And these are the fans who once whistled at Ronaldo; the club's record goalscorer, the most successful player in the club's history.

Bale has also been criticized for his love of golf. Reports emerged in some media outlets last season that the Cardiff-born star plays too much, does not mix with his teammates and goes to bed early.

As far as crimes committed by professional athletes go, playing golf and early nights are not exactly up there.

But the fans' frustration with his lengthy absences in recent seasons because of injuries is understandable. Muscle complaints have largely prevented Bale from filling the void left by Ronaldo, after the Portugal star departed for Juventus last summer.

Indeed, the winger has been injured so much during his time in Spain that last year some members of the Spanish media gave him the moniker ""Mr Glass.""

Though he made 29 league appearances for Real last season, he was mainly on the substitutes' bench towards the end of the campaign and did not join his teammates for the end-of-season lap of honor at the Bernabeu.

Gareth Bale came off the bench against Liverpool to score the winning goal in the 2018 Champions League final.

Where next?

But it's impossible to deny that Bale's time at Real has been anything other than a success.

Only Ronaldo has more Champions League titles than the Welshman -- Zidane won the competition once during his illustrious playing career.

In his time at the Spanish club, Bale has collected 14 major trophies and his 102 goals and 65 assists in 231 matches -- 0.72 goals or assists every game -- is undeniably impressive.

Bale has made more Real appearances and scored more goals for the Spanish giants than Zidane, whose playing career at Real was deemed a huge success.

The former Tottenham star has undoubtedly produced for Real on the big occasions -- Alfredo di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas and Ronaldo are the only players to have scored more goals in European Cup finals.

No British player has won more major titles or scored more top-flight goals abroad but, despite the statistics and the successes, Bale finds himself at a crossroads.

Gareth Bale will likely be playing his football away from the Bernabeu in the new season.

The player's agent told Sky Sports News Tuesday that his player will not move on loan. ""There will be no makeshift deals to get him out of the club. Gareth is one of the best players on the planet. I can guarantee you he will not be going on loan to any club,"" said Jonathan Barnett.

With three years remaining on his reported $18.7 million per year contract, Europe's top clubs will perhaps be unwilling to take that risk on an injury-prone 30-year-old, which is why he has been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League.

The transfer window in China closes next Wednesday and Bale will reportedly have offers of wages totaling more than $1 million per week should he choose to move to Asia.

It feels like an undeserving and underwhelming way for the career of a Real legend to peter out, but such is the circle of life at one of the world's most ruthless and successful clubs.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

On September 12, two L.A. County deputies were shot multiple times in the head and face by an unknown gunman near the MLK Transit Center in Compton. Both deputies survived the attack and remain in the hospital in critical but stable condition , Villanueva said on Monday.

The county has pledged $100,000 in reward money to information that leads to the gunman's arrest and conviction, and two private donors offered an additional $75,000 to help find the shooter, Villanueva said.

If James matches the reward money being offered, that would bring the total to $350,000.

283,NBA champion Toronto Raptors deny Boston Celtics shutout with buzzer beater,"(CNN) Defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors delivered the most exciting finish of this year's Playoffs thus far in the team's second-round game against the Boston Celtics on Thursday.

A sublime piece of individual skill from Boston's Kemba Walker -- which included a blind bounce-pass assist to Daniel Theis -- put the Celtics ahead 103-101 with 0.5 seconds remaining on the clock.

The Celtics were celebrating the bucket as if they had won. They almost certainly had. Almost.

With 7'5"" rookie Tacko Fall waving his arms in front of Kyle Lowry, the six-time All-Star looped a high inbounded pass across court to the open OG Anunoby, who got the three-point shot off with 0.2 seconds remaining.

The ball fell through the net to the rapturous celebrations of the Raptors.

OG Anunoby had just 0.5 seconds to catch the ball and get his shot off to secure the game-winning three-point shot for the Toronto Raptors.

The Celtics have been rampant so far in the Playoffs, not dropping a single game in a 4-0 shutout of the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, before taking a 2-0 over the reigning champion Raptors.

After the game, Lowry said : ""I was just waiting. Just waiting for the right moment and I seen Jaylen Brown step up a little bit on Marc [Gasol], and I just had to make a precise pass to a heck of a shooter in OG.""

""The pass was nothing,"" he continued . ""OG made the shot. All the credit goes to the shot, man. That's a tough shot. Give OG that credit. The pass was just to get it to a guy like OG. It's OG's moment, man. That's a great moment for that kid.""

The Boston Celtics believed they had sealed the win after taking the lead with 0.5 seconds left. But the Raptors' clutch play won the day.

No team in NBA history has overcome a 3-0 Playoff deficit, so this win was crucial to the Raptors' hopes of defending their title.

It truly was a team effort from the Raptors. Lowry may have topped the scoring with 31 points, but each one of their starters recorded at least 10 points.

The Celtics' loss leaves the fith-seed Miami Heat as the only undefeated team left in the Playoffs. The Heat hold a 2-0 lead over the number one seed Milwaukee Bucks.

Nash to the Nets

Elsewhere in the NBA, having lost 4-0 to the Raptors in the first-round of the Playoffs, the Brooklyn Nets have made a new signing.

Last summer saw them acquire perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.

This time however, it is a new coach.

Two-time MVP Steve Nash will take on the first head coach role of his career as he takes over in Brooklyn.

He'll be stepping in for interim head coach Jacque Vaughn, who is being retained as an assistant head coach.

Since retiring, Nash has worked with the Golden State Warriors as a player development consultant.

""I am honored to have this opportunity with such a first-class organization and would like to thank Sean, Joe and his wife, Clara, for having faith in my ability to lead this team forward,"" said Nash in a press release from the team.

New Brooklyn Nets coach Steve Nash was enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.

""Coaching is something I knew I wanted to pursue when the time was right, and I am humbled to be able to work with the outstanding group of players and staff we have here in Brooklyn. I am as excited about the prospects of the team on the court as I am about moving to Brooklyn with my family and becoming impactful members of this community,"" Nash said.

""After meeting with a number of highly accomplished coaching candidates from diverse backgrounds, we knew we had a difficult decision to make,"" said General Manager Sean Marks. ""In Steve we see a leader, communicator and mentor who will garner the respect of our players.

""I have had the privilege to know Steve for many years. One of the great on-court leaders in our game, I have witnessed firsthand his basketball acumen and selfless approach to prioritize team success.

""His instincts for the game, combined with an inherent ability to communicate with and unite players towards a common goal, will prepare us to compete at the highest levels of the league.

286,Magnus Carlsen wins richest and most-watched online chess event ever,"The Norwegian world champion has won the finale of the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour , the richest and most-watched chess event in history.

Over the week-long final game between the two chess titans, Carlsen had to come from behind three times, before finally defeating Nakamura in an Armageddon tiebreak -- a deciding game which must have a winner, where White is given more time but a draw means victory for Black.

Sauron still good — Magnus Carlsen (@MagnusCarlsen) August 20, 2020

""I don't know what to say, there were just so many twists and turns. Ultimately, it's a bit random that everything is decided by one game, but it has to end at some point,"" the 29-year-old said after his victory.

""[Nakamura's] just very, very resilient and I just found the whole match very difficult and unpleasant to play. At some points, I felt that I was outplaying him and then he started turning it around.

""I never felt I had the energy and never felt at any moment cruising, so it was just a never-ending struggle. That's why it became so close.""

Carlsen and Nakamura have had a fierce rivalry spanning over 10 years. In 2016, Nakamura likened Carlsen to Sauron from 'The Lord of the Rings' -- something Carlsen seemed to take great joy in referencing on Twitter after his victory on Thursday.

After in-person chess tournaments were canceled earlier this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, Carlsen organized the online Chess Tour to keep players and fans alike entertained.

The Tour consisted of four separate events, which began in April, and the grand finale. The total prize fund for the Tour was a record-breaking $1 million.

The Norwegian grandmaster went on to win three of the four stages, losing only one match at a knockout stage to Nakamura, before winning the Grand Final.

Nearly 70 million TV and online viewers tuned in to watch the five events. It was broadcast in 10 languages across the world and the Grand Final was at times the most-watched TV show in Norway.",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
287,Tokyo 2020 hopeful Sophie McKinna on working two jobs to achieve Olympic dream,"(CNN) Working two jobs is a lot for anyone to take on, let alone an elite athlete on a mission to make her first Olympic Games .

That's been the reality for British shot putter Sophie McKinna who has been balancing her dream of Olympic glory with work as both a custody officer and gym instructor for years.

Her work with the local constabulary makes up the majority of her income and serves as a perfect distraction from her sporting career, even if things get occasionally heated.

""We're like the bouncers. If people start kicking off, we deal with that so it's an interesting job,"" she told CNN Sport.

""It gets the blood pumping sometimes when you have someone difficult.""

Sophie McKinna rejected funding in order to keep her routine.

Rejecting funding

The nature of the job requires McKinna to keep her calm during some testing situations but it's a challenge she's enjoyed as her throws keep getting bigger.

""You walk in and every day is different,"" she said. ""You don't know what you're going to get.

""I really enjoy my work and it gives me that headspace away from athletics.""

The recent lockdown has only underlined how important such a distraction is to McKinna, who has temporarily stepped away from her role to keep herself safe from the virus.

She's been able to continue training in her garden but is struggling with living, sleeping and practicing in the same place.

It's for this reason that McKinna opted to reject funding from British Athletics earlier this year, a move that saw her turn down £15,000 a year and the chance to turn fully professional.

What seems like a strange decision made perfect sense to McKinna who was determined that nothing would upset her preparation ahead of an Olympic year.

""If I became a professional athlete, my brain would turn to mush because I'd be too close to it,"" she said.

""I've learned that in isolation because I'm right on top of where I'm training [...] so you don't get that little spark or buzz that I usually get.

""If I became a professional athlete, that would be my reality every day and I don't think I'd cope particularly well with it.""

McKinna started her youth career off as a sprinter.

'Painful' postponement

McKinna had all but guaranteed her seat on the plane to Tokyo 2020 this summer before the spectacle was postponed amid the coronavirus crisis.

She had already thrown the required qualifying distance at the Doha World Championships in 2019 and just needed to finish in the top two at the British championships -- something well within her capabilities.

Admitting her initial reaction to the postponement was one of disappointment, the 25-year-old was quick to put things into perspective.

""It was painful and the instant reaction is to think there has to be some way for it to go ahead,"" said McKinna, who worked tirelessly for 12 years to get into her enviable position.

""Sport is hugely important in my life but people losing their lives, losing their loved ones, is so much more important than me throwing a ball as far as I can.""

McKinna was excited to represent her country before organizers postponed Tokyo 2020.

'Typical teenager'

Although sport was seemingly her destiny -- her grandad was a professional footballer and manager of Norwich City -- shot put wasn't her initial calling.

Instead it was the more glamorous appeal of sprinting that caught her attention first, and her talent was clear to see at a local level.

Despite a host of county medals, she knew she'd never break into the world's elite as a sprinter.

It was, in fact, her mother who persuaded her reluctant 13-year-old daughter to have a go at throwing.

""As a typical teenager I said 'No, I'm not doing that, it's not cool, no chance.' I obviously ended up doing it because she had paid for it and I'd get in trouble if I didn't,"" she recalls.

Virtual competition

Within eight weeks of that first session, McKinna finished second in her age group at the national championships and quickly recognized her own her potential.

She hasn't looked back since.

Last year saw her throw a lifetime best at the World Championships in Doha, a moment met with pure ecstasy and a celebratory run across the track.

It was that throw that all but confirmed her place in Tokyo, an experience that will now have to wait until next year.

In the meantime, McKinna has had to make do with virtual competitions over video calls.

She and a number of other British athletes have so far competed in two virtual competitions where amateurs from around the world are encouraged to video themselves throwing whatever they have at their disposal.

The initiative has also been raising money for the British NHS as it continues to fight the pandemic.

""It's something close to my heart and it's something I want to get involved in,"" said McKinna, whose sister works in a hospital.

""It's also about putting throwing into the forefront. You don't normally get to see shot put on the television; it's normally the running events, so it's nice to be the sole event.

""It's really nice to see. People were drawing chalk circles on the floor and just giving it a go.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport
288,"Novak Djokovic: 'He's going to be the bad guy the rest of his career,' says John McEnroe","(CNN) Novak Djokovic hitting a line judge with a ball has become one of the enduring images of an already bizarre season of tennis.

The 17-time grand slam winner was disqualified from the US Open, a tournament he was favorite to win to close the gap on Rafael Nadal's total of 19 grand slam wins and Roger Federer's 20.

With the French Open set to start at the end of the month, the world No.1 still has an opportunity to add to his all-time tally during this curtailed season -- but has the Serb tarnished his reputation?

Seven-time grand slam champion John McEnroe, who was famous for his on-court outbursts, believes the incident will have an impact.

""The pressure just got to him I think,"" McEnroe, himself disqualified from the 1990 Australian Open for misconduct, told ESPN . ""... Now whether he likes it or not, he's going to be the bad guy the rest of his career. It'll be interesting to see how he handles it.""

""If he embraces that role, I think he could recover,"" added McEnroe. ""He's got a lot of things going for him, but this is obviously a stain that he's not going to be able to erase.""

Novak Djokovic apologizes to the line judge.

Djokovic left Flushing Meadows without speaking to the media, but did write an apology on his Instagram account, saying he was ""extremely sorry to have caused her such stress.""

McEnroe knows all too well how hard it is to shake a ""bad boy"" reputation in tennis and was surprised somebody with as much experience as Djokovic would make such an error.

""Just when you think something crazier couldn't happen [in 2020], it does happen,"" he said. ""We talked before the event that the only way Novak could lose is if he beat himself.

""I didn't anticipate in my wildest dreams that this would happen. So it's terrible for everyone, it was a rookie mistake.""

The disqualification is the latest incident during what has been a difficult summer for Djokovic. First, he arranged a tournament in Croatia which failed to observe social distancing regulations and resulted in him and a number of top players testing positive for Covid-19.

Then, he spearheaded a new breakaway players' association, the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), drawing criticism from Federer and Nadal.

Kyrgios starts Twitter poll

Nick Kyrgios, often dubbed the ""bad boy"" of tennis' current generation, posted a tongue in cheek Twitter poll asking what his punishment would have been in the same situation.

We'd be bailing you outta jail right now — Tommy Paul (@TommyPaul1) September 6, 2020

Five, 10 and 20 years were the options, with 20 winning by a considerable margin at the time of writing.

""We'd be bailing you outta jail right now,"" American player Tommy Paul responded.

Former British tennis player Tim Henman, who was disqualified in similar circumstances when he hit a ball girl at Wimbledon in 1995, believed Djokovic made a mistake by not facing up to the media following the incident.

""Unfortunately he's compounding the error,"" he told Prime. ""He needs to face up to it, apologize and accept he made a mistake. By, in essence, running away, it's going to go on longer.""

289,Dominic Thiem dedicates US Open win to family after 'so many sacrifices',"(CNN) Newly-crowned grand slam champion Dominic Thiem has dedicated his US Open triumph to his family for making ""so many sacrifices"" over the years in support of his career.

The Austrian, 27, came from two sets down against good friend Alex Zverev in a brutal, nerve-shredding four-hour marathon to finally win the first major of his career -- after having previously fallen three times at the final hurdle -- and make history.

Thiem is part of the younger generation of players from whom much was expected but had been unable to dethrone the aging trio of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. But, finally, tennis has a new men's grand slam champion -- and the first born in the 1990s.

The new US Open champion also etched his name into the record books by becoming the first player in the Open Era, which began in 1968, to rally from two sets down and win a final at Flushing Meadows

With Federer and Nadal not traveling to New York, and Djokovic suffering an ignominious disqualification in the fourth round for hitting a line judge with a ball, a golden opportunity was presented to the tournament's remaining players to become the first new men's grand slam champion for six years.

Eventually, amid all the headlines about players who weren't at the US Open, Thiem was the one able to hold his nerve.

""I cannot realize it yet, but it's definitely the biggest goal in tennis what I achieved, winning a slam title,"" he told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell. ""There is nothing better than that and all the hard work paid off and also all the hard work of my family, of my team.

""They made so many sacrifices. They drove hundreds of thousands of kilometers with the car to bring me to practice and I think today's also the day where I gave back a lot.

""It's a huge day for me, but also for everybody who was involved basically since the beginning of my life to get to moments like this.""

Thiem and Zverev meet at the net following the Austrian's victory.

Given the absence of the 'Big Three' from the latter stages of this tournament, questions will continue to be asked of the younger generation of players -- known as the 'NextGen' -- until they start to win major tournaments regularly.

However, Thiem says the absence of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic only exacerbated the pressure of winning a first grand slam, rather than alleviate it.

""Nobody really from us players talked about it,"" Thiem, the son of tennis coaches, said. ""It was somewhere in the back of our heads when the moment arrived, when Novak was out, because, of course, it increased the chances of the eight remaining players.

""But it also but also put a huge amount of pressure on each of us because the chance to win this title was a little bit higher than to win the title if the 'Big Three' are around.

""Everybody knew that and that was not easy. Well, the next slam [French Open] is just around the corner and two of the big three are back there again, but I guess that Sasha, me and three or four other guys are really almost with them from the level and it's going to be interesting how it develops.""

Dominic Thiem slumps to the floor after the winning point.

With 16 career titles to his name prior to the US Open and a career-high ranking of No. 3, Thiem was widely considered the most likely of the NextGen stars to win a grand slam title.

The 27-year-old has reached two of his three grand slam finals since welcoming former professional Nicolas Massu, the only man in the modern era to win gold in singles and doubles at the same Olympics, onto his coaching team at the start of last year and has enjoyed a stark improvement to his game.

But following defeats in all three -- at the 2018 and 2019 French Open finals and the Australian Open final at the beginning of this year -- Thiem admits that doubts about whether he'd ever win a grand slam started creeping into his mind.

""There are always doubts after every single final, after every of these three finals are lost there was doubt because I didn't know if there was ever a chance to come back [to another slam final] as the level in tennis is a super high,"" Thiem, who made his ATP Tour debut in 2011, said.

""I mean, if you're not on your top, you can lose to anybody in the draw and the same doubts were here before the match and also so during the match: 'What happens if it goes 0-4? What happens if I don't take this chance? Will I ever get another chance again?'

""So there are always doubts and it's a big, big relief that, well, these doubts are gone now.""",https://edition.cnn.com/sport

""The Mission found reasonable grounds to believe that Venezuelan authorities and security forces have since 2014 planned and executed serious human rights violations, some of which -- including arbitrary killings and the systematic use of torture -- amount to crimes against humanity,"" said Marta Valiñas, chairperson of the UN mission.

""Far from being isolated acts, these crimes were coordinated and committed pursuant to State policies, with the knowledge or direct support of commanding officers and senior government officials.""

The 411-page report is the first published by the UN mission. Commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council, it includes 48 in-depth case studies and expands on the extrajudicial executions, politically motivated detentions and torture, as well as protest-related violence.

294,The strange story of Mexico's presidential plane lottery,"The Shouting Children of the National Lottery are a tradition in Mexico. But this was a lottery like nothing the country has ever seen -- the short story behind it involves nearly a decade's worth of allegations of corruption, a $218 million plane, a politician who tries and fails to sell that plane, and of course, the novel coronavirus.

The longer story? Let's dive in.

People watch the raffle from an outdoor screen at Loteria Nacional Building on September 15, 2020 in Mexico City, Mexico.

""Not even Obama"" had a plane like this one

In 2012, Mexico's then-President Felipe Calderón decided it was time to upgrade his ride. He initiated the purchase of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, a luxurious, new jet compared to the older 757 model that had previously served as the presidential plane.

But by the time the plane arrived, Calderón had left office. It fell to his successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, to inspect the jet's custom trappings: Outfitted for only 80 passengers, the plane has wide leather seats, a conference room, and a presidential suite with a king-size bed and a private shower.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during press conference, with the presidential plane in the background on July 27, 2020.

Peña Nieto used the jet for his last few years in office and it became a favorite target of then-candidate, now-president Andrés Manuel López Obrador during his 2018 campaign.

""Not even Obama has a plane like this one,"" López Obrador has said, calling it a symbol of government excess and corruption, in a country struggling with poverty. He promised to sell the plane and return the money to the people.

How do we get rid of this thing?

López Obrador, who flies commercial, tried to stay true to his word. When he took office on December 1, 2018, his administration got right to work trying to find a buyer for the plane.

Turns out, there is not much of a market for a second-hand, custom-designed airplane with a price tag of more than $200 million. It would cost millions more to retrofit for commercial use.

The government says it has fielded multiple offers for the plane since the beginning of 2019, but none of those agreements worked out. López Obrador has said his administration can't sell the plane for less than it is worth.

The plane remains unsold, parked in a hangar in Mexico City.

The Raffle

At the beginning of 2020, López Obrador's administration came up with a new idea for the airplane: a raffle.

Buy a ticket, and if you win, you -- yes you, Average Citizen of Mexico! -- would become the proud owner of a custom wide-body 787.

But the Mexican public quickly responded with several questions:

Where would the winner park the airplane?

Who would pilot it?

Who would maintain it?

Where would it be flown?

And crucially, who would pay for all of these things?

At the time, López Obrador offered part of a solution. ""We would offer the winner of the plane a service of maintenance for two years or one year,"" he said this January.

The President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, left, shows his ticket for the raffle of the presidential plane next to the general director of the National Lottery, Ernesto Prieto Ortega, on March 3, 2020.

Government estimates put yearly maintenance costs at around $1.7 million.

""It sounds like a joke, right,"" Mexico City resident Bryan Diaz told the AFP in January.

His sentiment was widely shared among Mexicans and the plane raffle soon became a running joke in the country. The hashtag #SiMeGanoElAvion, or #IfIWonThePlane, went viral with people sharing memes and jokes about the raffle prize.

It quickly forced the President to change course. But if selling the plane was the original goal, it was soon lost.

The Raffle -- minus the plane

López Obrador decided that the raffle would go on -- but the prize would no longer be the plane.

Instead, it would be a ""symbolic"" cash prize divided among 100 winners. Each winner would receive 20 million pesos, the equivalent of about $1 million, depending on the exchange rate.

At the time, the government hoped roughly 6 million tickets would be sold at 500 pesos each, about $25. The money raised would be used to pay the winners their money, and any excess funds would be used to donate medical equipment to the public health system -- and also help maintain the plane ahead of any eventual sale.

That plan, of course, requires people to actually buy the raffle tickets. And 500 pesos is steep in a country where government statistics show the average household only earned 16,500 pesos per month in 2018, about $825.

That's likely part of the reason ticket sales weren't great. An original plan to hold the raffle drawing in May was delayed due to lack of sales.

Then came the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Mexico hard. More than 675,000 cases and 71,000 deaths have been registered.

The raffle's purpose shifted again: Now, López Obrador's administration touts the excess raffle proceeds as supporting the government's battle against the pandemic. But it's unlikely to go far.

The final math

As of September 11, the government said it had sold just under 4.2 million tickets valued at a total of around $105 million. The final amount will likely be marginally higher since tickets were sold through to September 15.

Of the earnings announced so far, the government will owe roughly 95%, or about $100 million, to the 100 winning tickets drawn on Tuesday. That leaves about $5 million left over, which the government plans to donate to the public health system.

But if the money was spread equally throughout the 951 public health facilities treating the country's Covid-19 patients, each facility would receive little more than $5,000 each.

Or they could get lucky. The federal government has also effectively entered its public hospitals into the raffle, purchasing and distributing about 1,000 tickets to each facility -- or about 1 million tickets worth about $25 million in total. Should any hospital come up with a winning ticket, it will be allowed to use the $1 million in winnings to buy medical equipment.

Additionally, if no one claims a winning number, that sum will also be donated to the hospitals. But it is a game of chance.

For months, critics have accused the Mexican government of not adequately supplying hospitals with protective equipment or medical supplies through the entire pandemic, something the government has told CNN it denies.

They have not failed to notice that announcing that hospitals now might win more cash is not the same as drawing up a budget that adequately meets public health needs. In critics' eyes, the raffle is a public relations distraction.

So who wins?

All of this culminated in a 2.5-hour performance by the Shouting Children of the National Lottery, as they read out sets of numbers.

Winners of this contest -- concocted to rid the presidency of an albatross airplane and transformed into a campaign claiming to raise funds to battle Covid-19 -- will be announced in the coming days.

For the sake of the public health system in Mexico, many will be hoping the winners include public hospitals.",https://edition.cnn.com/world
295,'I thought I was going to die.' Inside Venezuela's mandatory quarantine motels,"""I sometimes am sleeping at night and I wake up thinking I am in the motel,"" she says, tearing up. ""I still feel traumatized.""

She, like the more than two dozen healthcare professionals or aid workers we spoke with to inform this report, asked CNN not to reveal their identity for fear of reprisal from the Venezuelan government.

Her ordeal began when her father died in the once-oil rich city of Maracaibo, in northeastern Venezuela. Doctors suspected that he was a victim of Covid-19, though test results were inconclusive. Still in mourning, his whole family was required to take a rapid test. Hers also came back inconclusive.

From that point on, her life was completely controlled by Venezuela's government, she says -- from where she slept to what she ate. ""I was immediately isolated from that moment on. I heard nothing from my family, I didn't have any contact with them, I couldn't get anywhere near them,"" she says. ""I felt frustrated, I thought I was going to die.""

First she was put in a government-run diagnostics center for three days, where she says she shared a room with no air conditioning with four other patients. She had to share a dirty bathroom with the other suspected cases, two of whom, she says, ""were in very poor health.""

Then she was told she would be transferred to a motel.

Unsanitary, crowded and prison-like

​Doctors we spoke to say Venezuela's government has been using motels and other makeshift facilities to quarantine patients suspected of having the novel coronavirus, in a bid to separate them from the general population and keep them from overburdening the country's already depleted and crumbling hospitals. But these facilities have earned a reputation for being unsanitary, crowded and prison-like, with many Venezuelans fearing being locked inside them.

""I couldn't do anything. It upset me, it bothered me,"" she says, recalling begging officials to let her quarantine at home. ""I told them that other countries isolate people inside their homes.""

She argued that she didn't need medical surveillance -- she felt fine, and had no symptoms. But ​authorities were unmoved. The mother of three was sent to a motel run by a local councilman with the help of three to four Cuban doctors, she says, estimating that about 100 suspected Covid-19 patients were held there in total.

Conditions at the motel were slightly better than at the diagnostics center but still uncomfortable, the woman said: She was given her own room, with her own bathroom, but that was about it. Like in the rest of Maracaibo, electricity was intermittent, which meant there was little use for the air conditioning or the TV in her room, and the toilet only functioned intermittently. She was given drinking water twice a day and in very limited quantities; and personal hygiene items were in short supply.

""I spent five days without toothpaste,"" she recalls.

A member of the medical staff disinfects the corridors of a hotel where suspected Covid-19 patients are staying on July 20 in Caracas, Venezuela.

She ​says she received no medical care other than testing and regular temperature measurements, and was forbidden from leaving her room, which was never cleaned during her stay. Food was given to her in small quantities and some meals were skipped, she says, prompting protests by other patients on social media.

But she says the worst was when she asked staff at the motel for feminine hygiene products. ""They told me they were going to provide me with personal hygiene supplies... they gave them to me 15 days later,"" she says. ""My sister went to the motel entrance several times to bring me the personal hygiene supplies and they told her that I wouldn't need anything because they'd provide me with everything.""

After 23 days inside, she was eventually cleared to leave. She ​says she never received a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test while she was inside, which detects the genetic information of the virus and is the best way of diagnosing those with Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization. She says she was given four rapid tests, which only detect antibodies in the patient's blood.

""The first two [tests], I didn't see the results, but the last two I knew they were negative,"" she says. ""I felt I was in there longer than I should've been.""

Her story is far from unique, according to several doctors and nurses -- especially in Maracaibo, where mandatory quarantine is one of few available tactics to contain the coronavirus.

The Venezuelan government did not respond to multiple requests for comment about conditions in hospitals and quarantine motels, or about its testing for Covid-19.

'One dies, another one comes in'

Maracaibo used to be a success story in Latin America, a powerhouse built on the economic boon brought by Venezuela's enormous oil reserves, with a gleaming Central University Hospital. But after years of mismanagement and lack of investment in the hospital, doctors say the hospital now has only nine available ICU beds, six hours of running water per day, intermittent power and one x-ray machine that hasn't worked in months.

This lack of equipment and basic infrastructure to deal with the novel coronavirus is a countrywide affliction in the impoverished country, with hospitals even in the wealthier capital of Caracas plagued by shortages of pharmaceutical supplies and even disinfectant. Today, one Venezuelan doctor told CNN that ""approximately half"" of hospitals designated to treat Covid-19 patients don't have enough personal protective equipment, water, or electricity.

""The world wasn't ready to deal with the coronavirus, but with a humanitarian and economic crisis of the kind we have in Venezuela, it's just much worse,"" a surgical nurse said. Amid the pandemic, packed Venezuelan hospitals can only take patients in when beds free up, operating like revolving doors, he said. ""One dies, another one comes in.""

Official data on the number of people who have been put under state-managed quarantine is not publicly available, but doctors, NGO workers and other experts told CNN that at least half of the more than 45,000 people officially listed as having recovered from Covid-19 likely spent time in a mandatory quarantine facility.

The authoritarian regime of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has touted this strategy, claiming victory over the virus with some of the lowest Covid-19 numbers in Latin America: just 485 official deaths among 60,540 officially confirmed cases as of September 13

But experts say the number of deaths and cases may be severely underreported due to insufficient testing, and overreliance on rapid antibody testing, which is considered less reliable than the WHO-recommended PCR tests.

Several NGOs and doctors told CNN that they believe many infections go unreported, and that in some cases patients die without even knowing they had Covid-19. ""There's at least twice as many cases than what is reported as deceased in the official lists, of people who died with acute respiratory symptoms, who most likely had Covid-19 and which are not in the definition of the ministry,"" one doctor told CNN.

The threat of quarantine may further muddle Venezuela's coronavirus statistics, as some citizens would rather suffer in silence and hide in their homes than be identified as ​possibly having been exposed to the virus and end up in a motel for weeks.

""Several people called me asking what they should do to avoid going to the hospital because they are afraid, afraid of being put in a motel,"" the surgical nurse said.

For them, the fear is not just of catching Covid-19, but what the government will do to you if it finds out.",https://edition.cnn.com/americas
296,"Another journalist found dead in Mexico, one of the most dangerous countries for reporters","(CNN) Another journalist was found dead in Mexico this week -- the fifth this year in the country's somber record of attacks against the press.

Veteran reporter Julio Valdivia was found Wednesday afternoon in Mexico's coastal state of Veracruz, in the municipality of Tezonapa, decapitated near railroad tracks. His blue motorcycle was found only a few yards from his body, according to Córdoba's Diario El Mundo, the newspaper where he worked.

The Veracruz government condemned the killing.

""As we have made clear before, there will be no impunity in this government,"" it said in a Twitter post Wednesday without providing details of Valdivia's death.

Whether Valdivia was killed for his reporting will be a central question for observers of press freedom and Mexican authorities. Valdivia's journalistic work is ""a possible lead to follow"" in his murder investigation, Veracruz's Attorney General's office said in a statement Wednesday.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Valdivia covered crime and security in Córdoba, and his career spanned two decades.

In Valdivia's obituary, his colleagues at Diario El Mundo remembered him fondly.

""'Valdivia' is how everyone knew him, always responding with a smile and using his unique phrase that characterized him: 'Let's go, this is urgent,'"" they wrote.

A woman and a girl attend the wake of murdered Mexican journalist Julio Valdivia in Tezonapa.

Valdivia leaves behind a wife and four children, the youngest just four years old, according to the newspaper.

Valdivia's death marks the fifth murder of a journalist in Mexico this year, according to CPJ, and the second in Veracruz state, making Mexico the deadliest country for journalists in 2020 thus far. In April, the decapitated head of journalist Víctor Fernando Álvarez Chávez was found in the state of Guerrero.

Last year, CPJ reported 11 journalists killed in Mexico, the highest worldwide, as it outpaced war-ravaged Syria, where seven journalists were murdered in 2019.

""I am shocked by the brutality of Julio Valdivia's murder, even in a country where violence against the press continues to rise, even as the country went into partial lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico's CPJ representative, told CNN.

Hootsen says Mexican authorities share part of the blame for failing to stop such crimes.

""Bar some exceptions, Mexican authorities, both state and federal, have shown themselves to be utterly incapable of properly investigating crimes against the press,"" he said. ""The cycle of violence and impunity continues to incentivize anyone who wants to attack the press to do so without any fear of being arrested, prosecuted and sentenced.""

Violent crime in Mexico has escalated in recent years, along with impunity. In 2018, 93% of all crimes went unsolved, according to government data. Last year Mexico recorded more than 35,000 homicides, a record number that exceeded the previous high of 33,341 in 2018. Many of the murders are linked to drug cartel violence.

Ties between local officials and gangs can also add to the culture of impunity that makes reporting so risky, according to Reporters without Borders.

""Collusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists' safety and cripples the judicial systems at all levels,"" the group says on their website. ""As a result, Mexico is sinking even deeper into a spiral of violence and impunity and continues to be Latin America's most dangerous country for reporters.""

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Thursday that it's the government's ""duty"" and ""obligation"" to investigate Valdivia's death.

""I know Tenozapa and I know the importance of the newspaper El Mundo from Córdoba, and how heroic it is to do journalism in that region as in others in the country,"" the president said when asked about the murder. ""That is why it is necessary to investigate and punish those responsible in all cases.""",https://edition.cnn.com/americas
297,Unchecked fires could turn the Amazon into a savannah,"(CNN) Fires continue to rage at high levels through the Amazon in Brazil for the second consecutive year, raising concerns among scientists that the rainforest's destruction could eventually reach a point of no return.

Since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office, governmental measures to curb illegal fires have shown little impact, as flames and deforestation erase vast swathes of the world's biggest rainforest.

Most fires in the Amazon are set by land-grabbers and wildcat ranchers, seeking to transform parts of the rainforest into their own lucrative agricultural enterprises. And this August was a particularly bad time for such fires: Preliminary data collected by the National Spatial Research Institute (INPE) show 29,307 fires in the Brazilian Amazon last month.

However, due to a technical issue with the NASA satellite tracking fires, experts say that figure could be even higher. The final tally of fires recorded in August is expected to rise 2% above the August 2019 total, says Albert Setzer, INPE's senior scientist -- which would make this August the worst in 10 years.

The more fires there are, the faster the rainforest is transformed into grasslands for illicit cattle and soy-growing operations. According to research from NGO MapBiomas , which tracks land use in Brazil, 95% of the deforested area in Brazil in 2019 wasn't authorized. ""Most of (the fires) are illegal,"" said Tasso Azevedo, a former head of Brazil's forest service and coordinator of MapBiomas.

Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon biome reached 1,830 square miles, an area bigger than Rhode Island state, in the period from January to July 2020,. August figures for deforestation are yet to be released.

A tipping point?

As the trend goes on, the Amazon is speeding toward a tipping point, when large areas of the rainforest will no longer be able to produce enough rain to sustain itself, according to Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil's leading climate scientists and researcher at the University of Sao Paulo.

Once that happens, the rainforest will begin to die, eventually turning into savannah, said Nobre.

The Amazon serves as an "" air conditioner "" for the planet, scientists say, influencing global temperature and rainfall patterns. And a healthy Amazon also absorbs carbon dioxide, while fires do the opposite, releasing massive quantities of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The Brazilian Amazon's deforestation has accelerated since Bolsonaro took office in 2019, and environmentalists accuse the president of encouraging development on protected lands.

Pressure from international investors and companies this summer pushed the Brazilian President to issue a 120-day moratorium on July 15, banning fires in the Amazon and in the Pantanal, which is the world´s largest wetland area.

However, INPE´s data appears to show that the ban was utterly ignored. From July 15 to the end of August, the fires in Amazon remained at the same level (around 35,000) and almost quadrupled (from 2035 to 7320 fires) in the Pantanal, compared to the same period in 2019.

Brazil also launched Operation Green Brazil 2 in May, which mobilized the Armed Forces to fight deforestation and fires in the Amazon together with the federal environmental agencies and local police forces.

But they too failed to halt the Amazon's destruction, acknowledged Vice-President Hamilton Mourão, who led the operation. ""We are late in the fight against deforestation,"" Mourão said in a Sept. 4 press conference, asking for more time to show results.

The last frontier: Amazonas

The Brazilian state of Amazonas is one of the last frontiers where forests remain mostly preserved. But even there, illegal operations of loggers and ranchers are expanding.

Deforestation has grown 209% in Amazonas state since Bolsonaro took office -- erasing 844 square miles of forest in less than two years.

Unregulated agricultural expansion drives local small farmers and ranchers further into the forest every year. ""The lands that are closer to the main roads are more concentrated in the possession of a few big landowners, so landowners with less economic power are pushed further into the forest, whether by economic pressure, political pressure or by the use of violence,"" said Rômulo Batista, senior forest campaigner of Greenpeace.

The most degraded areas border two federal highways in the south of Amazonas. In the city of Apuí, near to the junction of both roads, deforestation reached 110 square miles last year -- almost twice the deforestation of 2018.

And every time the agricultural frontier is pushed inside the forest, the Amazon gets closer to its tipping point.

Satellite view of forests in Apui in July 2020 show expanded area of cleared land.

One symptom of the accelerating deforestation is longer dry seasons, Nobre said. This will initially be felt in Brazil and elsewhere in South America, as the Amazon generates a great part of the rains for the rest of the country, and also affects the rains in neighboring Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.

And even farmers and ranchers will feel the consequences. ""This 'savannah-ization' of the Amazon will lead to a reduction in rainfall that will affect especially the agricultural sector, which is driving deforestation further. It's a real shot in the foot,"" Batista said.

If the Amazon one day disappeared altogether, Brazil's rainfall on average would be reduced by up to 25% , predicts one modeling exercise by researchers at Princeton University . Average temperatures would also be expected to rise 2 degrees in Brazil and 0.25 degrees worldwide.

Nobre predicts that the tipping point for when the Amazon can no longer sustain itself lies between 20% and 25% of deforestation. So far, it has lost 17% of its original area, according to INPE

""It's hard to say when it's going to happen, but we are seeing that it is coming faster than we previously thought,"" Nobre said.",https://edition.cnn.com/americas
298,Venezuelan health workers are getting cash bonuses from an unexpected source,"(CNN) Venezuela's frontline health workers are beginning to receive cash bonuses -- but accepting the gift puts them at the center of a political stand-off with global implications.

Last month, the US Treasury approved Juan Guaidó , Venezuela's opposition leader, to use Venezuela sovereign funds stored in the United States to pay a $100 monthly bonus to health workers for three months.

Guaidó wields little actual clout in the country -- which is controlled by embattled president Nicolas Maduro -- but was recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's legitimate head of state after disputed elections two years ago. The funds he is distributing were seized by the US from Maduro's government, as part of a larger strategy to force it out of power.

On Saturday, Guaidó announced that 3,000 Venezuelan workers had received an initial sum of $100 ​-- a considerable sum for health workers who normally make less than $20 a month. Two doctors in two Venezuelan cities, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from the Maduro government, confirmed to CNN they had received the money.

Over the next three months, the opposition says it expects to distribute more than $18 million to more than 62,000 health workers​, according to a statement last month, as reported by Reuters. Priority will be given to recipients in border states where the coronavirus pandemic has hit hardest -- doctors in the western city of Maracaibo, one of the biggest Covid-19 hotspots in Venezuela, were among the first to receive the payment, the opposition announced in a tweet last week.

""The bonus is a significant boost, not just in terms of finances, but also as a motivation: we feel our work and sacrifices are recognized,"" said a doctor in Caracas who was hoping to receive his bonus soon and who also spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity.

But the funding is set to deepen the institutional conflict at the heart of the Venezuelan state. Guaidó hopes to demonstrate that his administration is more capable than Maduro's when it comes to looking after Venezuelan citizens, as they battle the pandemic with few resources after years of economic collapse, including hyperinflation.

But while Guaidó had to wait for the US authorization to access the funds, his rival also found support abroad. Maduro's ​government says its traditional allies have already stepped in to help​, sending hundreds of doctors from Cuba ​and medical supplies from both China and Russia.

The Maduro government has not reacted to Guaidó's announcement on disbursing funds, and Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.

Receiving the funds is technically illegal ​under Venezuelan law. Because of currency controls in Venezuela, the payment is processed on a digital platform widely used on the informal black market. The platform, AirTM, is illegal in Venezuela -- healthcare workers must access it through a virtual private network to bypass digital checkpoints set up by the Maduro government.

Between those digital obstacles and Venezuela's continuous power outages, actually getting the bonus is a grueling task, one doctor told CNN. ""One of my colleagues couldn't set up an account in the app because his internet is too bad. I don't know what he's going to do now,"" the doctor said.

Some who received the money told CNN that they intend to spend it on personal ​protective equipment and food supplies. Venezuela's hospitals regularly operate without basic services such as running water and electric power, much less oxygen and face masks.

Venezuela has reported over 50,000 cases and more than 400 deaths so far due to the coronavirus, according to figures released by the Maduro government. More than half of the total cases were reported in August, signaling the virus is spreading faster than in the first half of the year.

But Venezuelan opposition and international human rights organizations have questioned the government's capacity to collect health data, accusing Maduro of downplaying the crisis.",https://edition.cnn.com/americas

But the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau's home and their way of life is under threat, because the Amazon is burning.

""Nature is everything to us,"" says Awapy. ""It is our life, our lungs, our hearts. We don't want to see the jungle chopped down. If you chop it all down, it will definitely be hotter, and there won't be a river, or hunting, or pure air for us.""

That's why Awapy and representatives from five other indigenous communities took part in a drone-operating training course run by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Brazilian NGO, the Kaninde Ethno-Environmental Defense Association, last December.

According to Felipe Spina Avino, senior conservation analyst for WWF-Brazil, who helped run the training, the group became hooked the first time they flew the drones and were able to see the forest from above. ""They really accepted the technology with open arms and pretty quickly started to use it,"" he says.

Awapy Uru Eu Wau Wau is one of a group of indigenous people who use drones to monitor deforestation on their land in the Brazilian Amazon.

The drones create high-resolution images, video and GPS mapping data which can be used as evidence when reporting illegal activities to the authorities. Traversing dense jungle is hard on foot and the drones enable indigenous communities to monitor a much wider area, while avoiding potentially dangerous confrontations with illegal loggers and land-grabbers, says Spina Avino.

The WWF-Kaninde project has donated 19 drones to 18 organizations involved in forest protection in the Amazon.

Spina Avino says the technology empowers indigenous people. ""They can compile a case with a lot of evidence that they can send to the authorities which then have much greater pressure and much greater resource to act upon the illegal activities that are going on,"" he says.

Awapy leads a team of 12 on patrols into the rainforest to monitor deforestation and forest fires.

The first time the team used a drone, they found a 1.4 hectare area of land (roughly the size of two American football fields) that had been cleared of trees. Days later, they captured video of a helicopter spreading grass seed on the plot -- indicating that the land would be used for cattle pasture, says WWF.

WWF reports that the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) -- the Brazilian government body responsible for managing policies relating to indigenous people -- has been able to use geographical coordinates provided by the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau to investigate illegal logging in the region.

In December 2019, on their first surveillance after the drone-operating training course, the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau discovered a plot that had been illegally cleared of trees.

""Technology is not a silver bullet""

Indigenous communities are increasingly using drones as the machines becomes smaller and more affordable, says Jessica Webb, senior manager for global engagement at Global Forest Watch , an initiative of the World Resources Institute that develops technology to help protect forests worldwide.

The drones provided by the WWF-Kaninde project each cost around $2,000 -- roughly the same price as hiring a helicopter for one hour to do similar work.

As well as defending the rainforest, indigenous communities use drones to locate Brazil nut trees, which provide a vital source of food and income, and to monitor important species, such as the harpy eagle -- a bird sacred to the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau.

But technology is not a silver bullet, says Webb.

Pairing that tool with indigenous knowledge ""makes it so much more powerful,"" she says, adding that Amazonian people have an intricate understanding of the areas that are most important for protecting animals, endangered species and water sheds.

The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau tribe also use the drone to monitor important species, like the harpy eagle. They use its feathers for arrows and ceremonial headresses.

Amazon tribes face escalating threats

During last year's fires, Rondonia was one of Brazil's worst afflicted states

With enforcement teams operating at reduced capacity, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increase in illegal logging in the Amazon, according to indigenous rights group, Survival International.

A fire rages in the Amazon in northern Brazil's Para state, on August 16, 2020.

Activists worry that outsiders will bring the coronavirus into indigenous communities.

As of mid-August, no cases of Covid-19 had been reported on the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau's land, according to WWF. However, an increase in ""invaders"" -- as they are referred to by indigenous groups -- entering the area to carry out illegal activities, increases the risk of transmission, they say.

Awapy says he has received death threats from land-grabbers and illegal loggers for his work protecting the forest. According to NGO Human Rights Watch , Brazilians who defend the Amazon face threats and attacks from illegal loggers.

""I receive more and more threats, and people are closing in on me, checking my routine,"" says Awapy.

Despite the danger, he wants to keep fighting for both past and future generations.

""I like what I do, especially defending the jungle, because I grew up in it and I still live here. That's why I defend it, for those who died defending our territory, who have passed on. I want to keep fighting for their sake.",https://edition.cnn.com/americas

302,"With Canada and Mexico borders closed, Americans are trapped in their own health care system","(CNN) ""Want to hear the joke about insulin?"" goes the bleak gag about America's drug prices. ""You have to go to Canada to get it.""

But even that's not an option anymore.

Pandemic travel restrictions have made Americans prisoners of their country. Even within North America, Mexico and Canada have closed thousands of miles of border to all but essential travel, roiling plans for vacation, work, and school. For cash-strapped Americans, it has also cut off access to medicines and health care services that they can't afford at home -- at a time when money is tighter than ever.

Stephanie Boland's nine-year-old son was diagnosed with diabetes in December. Traveling to Canada to fill his insulin prescription took a half-day's drive from where they live in Brainerd, Minnesota, but it was worth it -- the purchase was a simple, over-the-counter affair. One pack of injection pens, which would last several months, cost less than a hundred dollars, she says, compared to a list price of $530 at home.

As their son's disease began to rewrite the routines of daily life, the Bolands planned to cross into Canada again to restock. Then the pandemic hit.

Boland, a masseuse, was forced to stop working. Her husband, a self-employed financial adviser, found his income hit by pandemic-related turbulence in the markets, too. Then their source for affordable insulin vanished behind a border that had never been closed before in the history of US-Canada relations

""We were going to make a trip north, one more trip in March, but then they closed the border,"" she said.

Buying insulin abroad

Only 1.5% of American adults who take prescription medications buy their drugs abroad, according to a June analysis by researchers at the University of Florida Gainesville, based on a 2015-2017 National Health Interview Survey.

Many medicines and medical services are cheaper in neighboring Canada and Mexico, thanks to price controls and the power of the US dollar . The difference is great enough that US insurer PEHP, which covers Utah's state employees, offers partially paid trips to Vancouver and Tijuana "" to help you save money on your prescriptions ."" In popular Mexican resort towns like Cabo San Lucas on the West Coast, or Tulum on the East Coast, pharmacies, doctors and dentists targeting US clientele dot the main drag, their prices on bright display. And the difference between those prices and the costs of the same drugs at US pharmacies can mean life or death.

No drug is a better-known example of that calculus than insulin, a vital hormone in the body's metabolism. Seven million American diabetics don't produce it naturally -- or not enough of it -- and need to inject it throughout the day. Without it, dangerous levels of glucose build up in the blood, damaging organs and producing a painful stupor. In a worst case scenario, lack of insulin can kill within three days.

Americans have been going to Canada for insulin since scientists learned how to produce it in labs at the University of Toronto in 1921. One of the first patients to try it was an American: Elizabeth Hughes, the teenage daughter of then-US Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.

""I'm so happy and elated,"" she wrote in a letter to her mother from Canada, describing her first self-injection and the ""enormous"" meal she enjoyed afterward. Before crossing the border, the 15-year-old had managed her condition by starving herself -- the only life-prolonging trick available to diabetics before insulin. Five feet tall, she weighed only 45 pounds.

A hundred years later, and after national soul-searching over the soaring cost of insulin, some Americans are still starving themselves. Daniel Carlisle, a Type 1 diabetic in Texas, has sometimes tried not to eat for days at a time, in an attempt to ration insulin. When he was 18 and short on cash, he even contemplated robbing a pharmacy, he says.

""I always do the math about how many days' supply of insulin I have in the refrigerator,"" the 60-year-old Texan says.

""That's how I know my lifespan at that point. My lifespan is measured in exactly how many days' worth of insulin I have in hand -- plus three days.""

Nuevo Progreso

For the past three years, buying insulin in Mexico has brought Carlisle security.

His trips started with a split tooth in 2017. ""I went to a dentist near where I live, and he said he could repair it for like $10,000,"" says Carlisle, who is uninsured. ""So I told him, 'Look I can't afford to send my kids to Harvard. Sure can't afford to send yours.""

He tried to ignore his aching tooth, but at the urging of his family, eventually drove a few hundred miles south from his home in Houston to the busy Mexican town of Nuevo Progreso.

""As soon as you come across the bridges, hawkers are saying ""Need a dentist? Need a pharmacy? It's just constant,"" he says. First he got his tooth fixed -- a root canal, bridge and crown altogether would end up costing him just $750. ""The dentists aren't marble palaces, but they're clean,"" he says.

Then he dipped into a pharmacy to ask the price of a vial of Humalog insulin, one of two kinds he takes. The answer: US $70. He checked the expiration date on the box, and then offered $20.

""You've got to negotiate!"" he says. ""I just tell them I'll die without it and then they'll lose a customer. They don't put up a fuss.""

A vial of the same insulin in the US has a list price of $274.70.

Since then, that's the only place where he buys insulin, Carlisle says, and he's never had a problem with its quality. But with the borders closed, he doesn't expect be back any time soon.

A vast gray area

Pharmacy staff in several drugstores in border towns in both Canada and Mexico tell CNN that they've seen significant drops in foot traffic since their countries' borders with the US closed. Though American scofflaws have been accused of crossing into Mexico for nonessential errands, overall border crossings have plummeted

One young man working at a pharmacy near Tijuana told CNN that business had fallen about 40% since the border closed. He asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak about the business.

Technically, bringing prescription drugs into the US is illegal. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created a gray area for small amounts: Importation ""might"" be allowed, according to the agency's website, if the medicine doesn't exceed a three month supply.

Staff at Mark's Marine Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada, less than an hour's drive from the US border, typically fill hundreds of orders for US customers each day, general manager Jordan Rosenblatt says, and rarely have any problem shipping it. With the borders closed, online ordering has spiked, he adds.

Reviews over the years on their Facebook page compare prices of all kinds of prescription drugs to those in the US, with commenters from as far as New Jersey and Texas. ""They sell and send me my asthma inhalers at a price that is non-predatory, unlike here in the U.S. Happiest gal today! Thank you!"" reads one.

But ordering online isn't for everyone -- there is always a risk that the medicine will be confiscated or that temperature-sensitive drugs like insulin could go bad waiting at customs or in US Postal Service delays.

And as the frustrations of border closures highlight, foreign health systems make a poor fallback no matter how you access them.

""For any given individual in the short run, going to Canada is a decent solution, but it's not a systemic solution,"" says Dr. Vikas Saini, a Harvard-trained cardiologist and president of the Lown Institute , a nonpartisan health care think tank.

US President Donald Trump has called to allow larger scale importation from Canada, among a raft of recent proposals to reduce the prices of certain US drugs. But that's unlikely to make a dent in the US market, Saini says: ""Canada is a country of about 30 million people. It doesn't have enough medication to provide all those prescriptions for the US -- a nation 10 times the size.""

Some Canadian health industry groups and patients agree. Since 2019, they've warned that Trump's importation plan could lead to drug shortages for Canadians -- a fear likely sharpened after witnessing global shortages of vital medical equipment in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.

A crumbling economy

As the pandemic wears on, the options are dwindling for Americans who can't afford to be sick in the United States -- especially after the cratering economy erased nearly 13 million jobs, taking health insurance options with them.

Even at Canadian prices , some are struggling to pay for their prescriptions. ""Recently, we're hearing about all the financial issues of people laid off,"" says Rosenblatt, the Vancouver pharmacy manager. ""We have American customers that have been working with us for years, and under these circumstances, we've sent what they needed and we tell them, 'Pay us when you can.'""

To make insulin more accessible, some US states have pushed for price caps on copays. The three companies which control the US insulin market offer discount plans, including new programs to which Americans who were financially impacted by the pandemic can apply for temporary access to cheaper or free insulin. And Walmart offers cheap insulin over the counter (though this is an older formulation that can make blood sugar management more complicated than newer, prescription versions.)

Yet many are still struggling -- and not just the nearly 28 million Americans who don't have health insurance, a number estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even Americans with health insurance, who benefit from negotiated prices that are lower than the list prices, sometimes still can't afford all the costs of living with diabetes.

In Dayton, Ohio, Mindi Patterson's family gets health insurance through her job as a Costco clerk. But even then, keeping up with the cost of insulin for both of her teenage sons and her husband is still a tightrope walk. ""We have had to dig through the trash for (discarded) reservoirs from insulin pumps, when we haven't had the money to buy the next bit of supplies,"" she says.

""Right now I have a refill for (my son's) insulin waiting, but I really don't have the funds just yet to pick it up. So they're holding onto it for me until payday,"" she said.

Sabrina Renaud, a 22-year-old dietary aide in South Carolina, works fulltime at a hospital that offers health insurance to employees -- but she earns about $1,300 per month after taxes, and says she simply can't afford the deductible, premiums, and copays of the company plan and still make rent. ""So I thought, I'm just going to have to wiggle through this without health insurance,"" she says.

Renaud hasn't seen a doctor to renew her insulin prescription in more than a year. Instead, every couple of months, she messages a woman she's never met in real life, with a list of what she needs. So far, the life-saving supplies she needs keep turning up in the mail.

The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because redistributing prescription drugs is illegal, tells CNN that she has shipped insulin to hundreds of people over the years -- an effort that she describes as a ""necessary evil."" People from the US and abroad send spare vials and injection pens to her, and she says she sends them for free to any American who asks for it.

""I personally do this, gosh, an average of four times per week,"" she says.

""I could put out a tweet right now that someone needs (insulin brand) Humalog, and I'll probably get 100 responses saying ""I have extra,"" from all over the country,"" she says. ""Folks are willing to pay $50 to overnight it to someone who's in a really bad situation.""

She has even received large insulin donations from Canada.

An increasingly busy ""black market""

More than a dozen diabetic Americans interviewed for this article said they had participated in such an informal insulin exchange powered by social media, widely referred to as the ""black market."" Organizers are nodes in the network, using their prominence on platforms like Twitter to connect people who have insulin to those who don't.

""We have been left with no other choice,"" says emerging Minnesota politician Quinn Nystrom , whose campaign for Congress emphasizes affordable health care. A Type 1 diabetic herself, Nystrom helps distribute insulin donations and -- before the pandemic -- organized ""caravans"" to Canada to purchase insulin.

""Am I willing to break the law to keep American citizens alive? Yes,"" she says.

Demand for black market insulin has spiked since the pandemic began, said another organizer in Colorado, who asked to remain anonymous due to the illegality of the work. In the last week of July alone, she facilitated $24,000 worth of insulin donations, she estimates.

""Prior to this whole Covid-19 crisis -- let's say just six months ago or eight months ago, I might hear about someone who needed insulin maybe once a month,"" she says. ""Fast-forward to now, when people are losing jobs: In the last seven days, I have heard from 15 different people who are almost out of insulin and have no way to afford their next purchase.""

Daniel Carlisle, the Houstonian, has sometimes donated some of his own supply to fellow diabetics in Houston and Dallas. ""If someone died because they were lacking and I said I won't share with you, well, I've got a real moral issue with that,"" he says. ""If you were living in Houston and needed some insulin, I would drive over and give you a vial.""

But he does have cash flow limits, he adds. And if he can't restock in Nuevo Progreso soon, he'll have to ask for help on the same black market he once gave to.

""Right now I'm looking at February. If I can't make it to Mexico by then -- and have the money to make the trip -- I'll be in trouble,"" he says.",https://edition.cnn.com/americas
