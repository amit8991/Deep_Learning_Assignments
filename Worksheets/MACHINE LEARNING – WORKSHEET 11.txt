12.R2 shows how well terms (data points) fit a curve or line. 
Adjusted R2 also indicates how well terms fit a curve or line, but adjusts for the number of terms in a model. 
If you add more and more useless variables to a model, adjusted r-squared will decrease. If you add more useful variables, adjusted r-squared will increase.
Adjusted R2 will always be less than or equal to R2.

13.A cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between X and y. 
This is typically expressed as a difference or distance between the predicted value and the actual value.
The cost function can be estimated by iteratively running the model to compare estimated predictions against the known values of y.

14. SST is the squared differences between the observed dependent variable and its mean.
	SSR is the sum of the differences between the predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable.
	SSE is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value.
	SST = SSR + SSE
	
15.The evaluation metrics for linear regression are :MSE, MAE, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and RMSE
	Mean Squared Error (MSE):It is the average of the squared difference between the predicted and actual value.
	Mean Absolute Error (MAE) : This is simply the average of the absolute difference between the target value and the value predicted by the model.
	R-squared : This metric represents the part of the variance of the dependent variable explained by the independent variables of the model. 
				It measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable.
	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) : This is the square root of the average of the squared difference of the predicted and actual value.
