11.List :
A list is a sequence of elements in a specific order.
List are mutable.
List can store any type of element.
It is defined under square brackets[].

Tuple :
Tuple is a immutable sequence in python.
It cannot be changed or replaced since it is immutable.
It is defined under parenthesis().
Tuples can store any type of element.

Set:
Sets are unoreder collection of elements or unintended collection of items In python.
Here the order in which the elements are added into the set is not fixed, it can change frequently.
It is defined under curly braces{}
Sets are immutable.i.e it cannot be changed or replaced.

Dictionary:
A dictionary is a mapping from keys to values where the keys can be all sorts of different objects, 
in contrast to lists where the 'keys' can only be numbers.
They keys of a dict are much like a set: they have no order and you can test for their existence quickly.

12. In python , string data types are immutable.
	Code to replace + with space
	
	import re

	text = 'I+Love+Python'
	text = text.replace("+"," ")
	print(text)

13. he ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument. 
For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character 'B'.

 We use the type() function to find the type of any variable in python.

14.Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥
2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.

Solution:
import math

def findRoots(a,b,c):
    if a==0:
        print("Invalid")
        return -1
    
    d = b*b-4*a*c
    square_root_value = math.sqrt(abs(d))
    
    if d > 0:
        print("Roots are real and different")
        print((-b+square_root_value)/(2*a))
        print((-b-square_root_value)/(2*a))
    elif d == 0:
        print("Roots are real and same")
        print(-b/(2*a))
    else:
        print("Roots are complex") 
        print(- b / (2*a) , " + i", square_root_value) 
        print(- b / (2*a) , " - i", square_root_value) 
        

a = 1
b = 4
c = 3
findRoots(a, b, c) 

Output:
Roots are real and different
-1.0
-3.0

Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‘n’.

Solution:
num = int(input("Enter a number to find sum of natural numbers :"))

sum = (num*(num+1))/2

print("Sum of  first ",num," numbers is ",sum)

Output:
Enter a number to find sum of natural numbers :6
Sum of  first  6  numbers is  21.0
