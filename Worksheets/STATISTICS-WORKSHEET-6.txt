10. Bayes Theorem :
	Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. 
	It follows simply from the axioms of conditional probability, but can be used to powerfully reason about a wide range of problems.

11. Z-score :  Itâ€™s a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is.
12. T-test : The t test tells how significant the differences between groups are; In other words it lets you know if those differences (measured in means) could have happened by chance.
13. Percentile : Percentiles indicate the percentage of scores that fall below a particular value. They tell you where a score stands relative to other scores.
14. An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant.
15. An ANOVA test helps to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis.
